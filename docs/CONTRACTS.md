# Malpractice: system contracts for the content sweep

This is the agreement between the systems being built in parallel. If a contract here is wrong
or missing something, do not silently change it: tell the main session (SendMessage to
"main") what you need and why, and build against the contract as written meanwhile.

Project: `C:\Users\ZachBurgess\workspace\malpractice`, Godot 4.7.2, GDScript.
Godot binary: `"/c/Users/ZachBurgess/Desktop/Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64.exe/Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64_console.exe"`.
Design brief: `DESIGN.md`, plus the "Design decisions" section at the bottom of this file.

## Ground rules for every worker

- **File ownership is strict.** Only edit the files your brief lists. The core files
  `scripts/game.gd`, `scripts/player.gd`, `scripts/hud.gd`, `scripts/main.gd`,
  `scripts/items.gd`, `scripts/procedures.gd`, `scripts/world_item.gd`,
  `scripts/item_models.gd`, `scripts/supply_shelf.gd`, `scripts/surgery/minigame.gd`,
  `project.godot` and this file belong to the main session.
- **Do not touch the performance work:** `_attach_light_flicker` and `_add_occluders` in
  `game.gd`, `set_quality` / `_load_quality` / the FPS label in `main.gd`, the quality code in
  `look.gd`, the `[rendering]` section of `project.godot`, and `tools/bench.gd`.
- **Stubs.** Some files you own already exist as a stub written by the main session so the game
  keeps running. Replace the stub entirely; keep its public API.
- **Cross-file references:** prefer `const X := preload("res://...")` over relying on another
  file's `class_name`, because the global class cache only refreshes on an import. After you
  create a new script with a `class_name`, run `godot --headless --path . --import` once.
  Several workers share this project: if an import errors on a locked cache file, wait 20
  seconds and retry.
- **Scale:** `scripts/consts.gd` (`C`). One tile is `C.TILE` = 1.5 m, walls `C.WALL_H` = 3 m,
  eye height 1.7 m, +Y up, Godot forward is -Z.
- **Assets:** `Assets` autoload (`scripts/assets.gd`, licences in `ASSETS.md`). Everything
  degrades: `Assets.has(key)` false / `Assets.spawn(key)` null means build a primitive instead.
  Only CC0 assets unless the main session says otherwise. Do not download new assets without
  recording them in `ASSETS.md` under a heading for your work area.
- **Sound:** do not edit `tools/gen_audio.mjs`. Put new sounds in your own generator
  `tools/gen_audio_<area>.mjs` writing `audio/sfx/<area>_<name>.wav` (numbered `_01`, `_02`
  variants get picked at random). Play with `Audio.play("<area>_<name>", position_or_null)`.
  Same deterministic, dependency-free style as `gen_audio.mjs`.
- **No git commands.** Delete throwaway probe scripts when done.
- **Verify headless where possible, and with real windowed screenshots for anything visual.**
  Read the screenshots back and judge them honestly.

## Shared data (main session)

- `Items` (`scripts/items.gd`): `ITEMS[kind]` with name, consumable, batch `[min,max]`, fragile,
  `found` weights by container type or `"loose"`, `loose_surfaces`, `real_use`, `where`,
  `handling`. `CONTAINER_TYPES[type]` with `rooms`. `LOCKED` placeholder tab names.
  Surgical kinds: `anesthetic`, `gauze`, `forceps`, `tourniquet`, `bone_saw` (`Items.SURGICAL`,
  what a patient case can need), plus `suture_kit` (surgical and consumable, not in `SURGICAL`;
  see "Downed players"). Plus `guide`.
- `Procedures` (`scripts/procedures.gd`): `PATIENTS` (`bob`, `seal`, with weight and limb
  radius), `AILMENTS` (`gunshot`, `amputation`, and `stitches` with `player_only: true`) with
  steps `{id, label, item, uses, game, variant?, site}`, `roll(seed, shift)` (never a
  player-only ailment), `patient_ailments()`, `is_player_only(id)`, `requirements(ailment)`,
  `remaining_requirements(ailment, from_step)`, `difficulty(shift)`, `MINIGAME_SCRIPTS`.
- `ItemModels.make(kind: String, count: int = 1) -> Node3D` (`scripts/item_models.gd`): the
  visual for a stack, origin at its base, no collision. Checks `Assets` for `item/<kind>` first.

## Interaction (main session owns the plumbing)

The player aims with a ray from the camera (`C.INTERACT_RANGE` metres). Anything interactable is a
`CollisionObject3D` (usually `StaticBody3D` or `Area3D`) on physics layer `C.L_INTERACT`
(bit 16) or `C.L_PICKUP` (bit 8), in the group `"interactable"`, with a metadata
`interact_id` that is **identical on every machine** (derive it from tile coordinates or the
seed, never from instance ids). The collider may be a child: the game walks up the parents to the
first node that has the meta.

That node implements:

```gdscript
func interact_prompt(player) -> String   # "" means not interactable right now; e.g. "Open fridge"
func interact_hold() -> float            # 0.0 for a press, seconds for a hold
func interact(player) -> void            # HOST ONLY, called after the host validated range and sight
```

`player` is a `Player` node: `peer_id`, `player_name`, `slots` (see below), `global_position`.

## Interactable affordance (interactable-affordance sweep)

R.E.P.O.'s look, cited in DESIGN.md: what you can interact with is signalled primarily by a visual
cue on the object itself, not a permanently floating label. `scripts/aim_highlight.gd`
(`AimHighlight`) is the generic version of that: whatever the local player's crosshair is over
brightens slightly (a faint warm lift, a little more at its edges, faded in over 0.1 s; no outline
since 2026-09-18, it was too harsh), with a small ring in the crosshair (hud.gd), driven straight off the aim system above (`Player.aim_id` /
`aim_prompt`), local and purely cosmetic — every player highlights only what THEY aim at, no
network traffic, no interaction-logic change.

```gdscript
AimHighlight.set_highlighted(node: Node, on: bool)   # add/remove the rim on node's MeshInstance3Ds
AimHighlight.warm(parent: Node3D)                    # warmup.gd hook: compiles the shader once
```

`Player._update_aim_highlight()` (called from `_update_aim()`, local player only) turns the rim on
whenever `aim_id != ""`, the node is in group `"interactable"`, and `aim_prompt` does not begin
with `"!"` (the existing "can't use this right now" convention) — the same gate the crosshair
prompt already uses for its own styling. Technique: a copy of each of the target's biggest
`MeshInstance3D`s added as a child of it, 2 mm proud of its surface, front faces only, additive and
unlit, one material per highlight faded in by a tween.

This replaced a handful of always-on `Label3D` room/prop labels that duplicated this cue (the OR
supply shelf's "SUPPLY - SURGICAL" tag, the break-room blender's "BLENDER" tag): removed outright,
since the aim highlight plus the crosshair prompt already say the same thing without covering the
screen the whole time you are in the room. Navigational signage (the hospital's own room-name
signs over doorways, `hospital_builder.gd`'s `_sign_node`, "OR" / "EMERGENCY" / wing names) is
untouched: that is wayfinding, not "you can interact with this," and stays exactly as it was.

## Containers (containers worker)

Built by `scripts/hospital_builder.gd`. Each container node is in groups `"container"` and
`"interactable"`, has meta `interact_id` like `"ct_<tx>_<ty>_<n>"`, and implements:

```gdscript
var container_type: String                   # a key of Items.CONTAINER_TYPES
func slot_count() -> int
func slot_transform(i: int) -> Transform3D   # global; where an item stack sits inside
func is_open() -> bool
func set_open(open: bool, animate: bool = true) -> void
# plus interact_prompt / interact_hold / interact (toggle open/closed)
```

The host toggles containers through `interact()`; the game replicates `is_open()` to clients in
its snapshot and calls `set_open(value, true)` there. A container must not change its own open
state anywhere else. Opening calls `game.emit_noise(pos, 0.5, "container")` on the host only
(`get_tree().get_first_node_in_group("game")`).

`HospitalBuilder.build(gen, info)` additionally fills:

```gdscript
info["containers"]    = [{id, type, room_kind, wing, depth, node, position, slots}]
info["loose_anchors"] = [{position: Vector3, yaw: float, surface: "counter"|"tray"|"gurney"|"floor", room_kind: String, wing, depth}]
info["storage"]       = [{position: Vector3, yaw: float}] # the OR's storage shelves (2026-09-18; no supply shelf)
info["lectern"]       = {position: Vector3, yaw: float}   # in the break room
info["lab"]           = {centrifuge, vials, microscope, analyzer, specimens, sink, blood_fridge, fume_hood:
                         {position: Vector3, yaw: float}}   # the OR's lab wall, set dressing so far
info["personnel"]     = {mirror, scanner (the vein machine's hand plate): {position: Vector3, yaw: float},   # the personnel room
                         screen: {position (the glass's centre), yaw, height: float, size: Vector2 (3.2 x 1.7 m)},
                         lockers: [{position, yaw}] (4, one per player, left to right from the room),
                         sinks: [{position, yaw}] (5)}   # set dressing, but the mirrors reflect:
# scripts/personnel/mirrors.gd (built by HospitalBuilder from the same spots) renders the big mirror
# and the sink mirrors from reflected cameras, and shows the local player's own body to them only
# (Player.set_mirror_self; the body is on LightRooms.SELF = layer bit 16, which the first-person
# camera leaves out except while the carry camera shows the body: Player.set_carry_body).
```

Sweep 2: which room kinds a container type stands in is `CONTAINER_ROOMS` in
`scripts/level/room_furnish.gd` (`Items.CONTAINER_TYPES[type].rooms` still names the old kinds
and is not used for placement). Every wing has a supply closet (medicine fridge, drawer unit,
often a pegboard), a nurse station (station drawers, a trauma bag), a janitor closet (pegboard)
and at least one trauma bag on a hallway wall.

## Item spawning (containers worker)

```gdscript
# scripts/item_spawner.gd
static func plan(seed: int, shift: int, ailment_id: String, info: Dictionary) -> Array
static func shortfall_plan(seed: int, need: Dictionary, have: Dictionary, info: Dictionary,
		occupied: Dictionary, avoid: Array) -> Array
# Each entry: {kind: String, count: int, container_id: String ("" when loose), slot: int, anchor: int}
# `occupied` is {"ct_id:slot": true, "anchor:<i>": true}; `avoid` is an Array[Vector3] to stay far from.
```

Rules (sweep 2, supply raised about 50%): every needed consumable totals at least three times
`Procedures.requirements()`, in 6 to 9 stacks at different places; every needed tool exists three
times; red herrings come as 2 tool copies or 2 to 3 consumable stacks; every wing holds at least one
stack of something the case needs, and extra stacks lean toward deeper wings; nothing needed
spawns in `ItemSpawner.SAFE_ROOMS` (the entrance building's rooms and halls, the neutral area);
at least one needed item is far from the table; items the current ailment does not need also
spawn as red herrings; spawn counts respect `Items` batch sizes; deterministic from the seed.
Levels without `wing` on their containers and anchors count as one wing. The game instantiates
`WorldItem`s from the plan. `tools/spawncheck.gd` checks all of it.

## World items (main session)

`scripts/world_item.gd`, a `RigidBody3D` on layer `C.L_PICKUP`, group `"interactable"`,
meta `interact_id` `"it_<n>"`. Fields: `item_id`, `kind`, `count`, `state` (`IN_CONTAINER`,
`LOOSE`, `ON_LECTERN`), `container_id`, `slot`, `value` (loot only: dollars for the whole stack,
reported as `v` when above 0). Host-simulated physics when dropped; clients lerp to the snapshot
transform. Picking up removes the node and fills a hand slot (value included).

## Hands (main session)

`Player.slots` is an `Array` of `C.CARRY_CAP` (4) dictionaries `{kind: String, count: int}` plus
`v: int` (sell value) on loot; `kind` `""` when empty. `Player.selected` is 0..3 (keys 1-4, the
wheel). Stacks of the same kind merge when `Items.stacks(kind)` (consumables, stackable loot).
Bulky loot takes its slot and a second one, stored as `{kind: "", count: 0, of: <head index>}`:
not free, but invisible to code that walks slots looking for stacks. Host authoritative,
replicated in the snapshot. See "Inventory and money" for the helpers; do not assign slots by hand.

## The OR's storage shelves (2026-09-18; the supply shelf is gone)

`scripts/containers/storage_shelf.gd`: open steel shelving (a container that never closes), built by
`game._add_landmarks` at `level_info.storage` into `game.storage_nodes` (ids `storage_<i>`). Pressing E
on it with something selected puts that stack, any item, in the free spot nearest your line of sight
(`game.storage_place`); what sits there are ordinary world items (`IN_CONTAINER`), taken back with
their own E. `game.shelf_count(kind) -> int` is what the OR has ready: on the storage shelves plus
in any player's hands (the OR screen's supplies, the dispatch fax's missing list).
Host helpers for tests and the dev panel: `game.stock_storage(kind, count)`, `game.clear_storage()`,
`game.give_hand(p, kind, count)`, `game.hand_step_item(p, table_index)`.
`game.shelf` / `game.shelf_node` are vestigial (always empty / null).

## Patient body (patients worker)

```gdscript
# scripts/patient_body.gd
static func create(patient_id: String) -> Node3D       # a PatientBody, lying on its back, origin at the table top centre
func set_ailment(ailment_id: String) -> void            # shows the gunshot wound or the infected limb
func has_site(site: String) -> bool
func site_transform(site: String) -> Transform3D        # global; +Y out of the body surface, X along the limb or across the wound
func set_vitals(v: float) -> void                       # 0..100: breathing rate/depth, pallor, twitching when low
func set_sedation(s: float) -> void                     # 0 awake .. 1 fully under; low values fidget
func stir(strength: float) -> void                      # a sudden jolt right now
func set_bleeding(site: String, amount: float) -> void  # 0..1 blood at a site
func apply_flags(flags: Dictionary) -> void             # idempotent: "bullet_removed", "tourniquet" (float), "amputated", "dressed", "sedation"
                                                        # REPLACES the flag set (no merge): always pass every flag the case has
func flatline() -> void
func site_section(site: String) -> Dictionary           # limb sites: {half_up, half_side, axis_depth, shape}; {} elsewhere
func infection_start(site: String) -> float             # metres along the site's +X to where the body's infection begins; INF if none
func make_severed_limb(parent: Node) -> Node3D          # adds a static copy of the limb an amputation removes, posed where it is; may be null
func expose_site(site: String, centre: Vector2, radii: Vector2) -> void  # clear clothing inside an ellipse on the site plane (site X, Z) while a step is up
func cover_site() -> void                               # undo expose_site
```

Sites every patient provides: `injection`, `gunshot`, `limb` (above the infection, where the
tourniquet goes), `limb_cut` (the amputation line). Along the limb the order is always
tourniquet (`limb`), then the cut (`limb_cut`), then the infection, so the saw goes through
healthy tissue. The game places the body on the table and calls these; minigames may call
`set_bleeding` and `stir` for live effects.

`site_section`: `half_up` is skin-at-the-site to limb axis, `half_side` the half width across the
limb (site Z), `axis_depth` how far below the site origin the axis runs, `shape` a superellipse
exponent (2 round, 6 boxy). Minigames read limb geometry only through `site_section`,
`infection_start` and `make_severed_limb`, never through `PatientBody.parts`.

**The seal's Blender model (2026-09-14).** `PatientBody.create("seal")` builds the seal from the
`patient/seal` asset (`assets/models/patients/seal/seal.glb`, made in `art/seal/`) through
`scripts/patients/seal_model_builder.gd`, and falls back to the lofted `seal_builder.gd` when the
asset or its shader is missing (`SealModelBuilder.procedural_only = true` forces the fallback, for
tools). Same frame and API; what differs underneath:

- `site_transform` returns the rest pose (the Idle clip's first frame). The `site_*` anchor nodes sit
  on the neck, spine and `flipper_fore.L` bones, so every overlay on them (tourniquet, wound,
  dressings, bleeding decals) follows the clips. Sections come from the mesh: `limb` half_up 0.0335,
  half_side 0.0659; `limb_cut` 0.0270 / 0.0626 (both also carry `half_down`, the flatter underside);
  `infection_start` 0.0972 and 0.0216.
- Motion: no AnimationPlayer runs. The builder samples the Idle, Fidget, Twitch, Stir and Flatline
  clips every frame and blends them from the body state: Idle's rate follows the breathing rate and
  its ribs the breathing depth, `stir()` restarts Stir weighted by its strength, fidget and low-vitals
  twitching blend their clips in, `flatline()` fades into Flatline. `breath_amp` is 0 (the ribs bone
  breathes); `rig.position`'s jolt offset still applies.
- `skin_mats` holds the model's two ShaderMaterials (`seal_skin.gdshader`): `pallor`, `grey`,
  `infect` and `breath` as before, plus `infect_front`, `highlight_injection`, `highlight_gunshot`.
- The amputation swaps the model's `Seal_Paddle_L` for its `Seal_StumpCap_L`; the fishing line shows
  for the amputation ailment until the paddle comes off. `make_severed_limb` duplicates the static
  `Seal_PaddleSevered_L` (paddle, cut face, line) at the paddle's current place.

**Bob's Blender model (2026-09-14).** `PatientBody.create("bob")` builds Bob from `patient/human_bob`
(`assets/models/characters/human/bob.glb`, made in `art/human/`) through
`scripts/patients/bob_model_builder.gd`, falling back to the reshaped Kenney rig in `bob_builder.gd`
when the asset or its shaders are missing (`BobModelBuilder.kenney_only = true` forces it). Same
frame and API; underneath:

- The model lies in its `Lying` clip (frame 0 for `site_transform`), turned so the head is at -X and
  his right arm on +Z, centred along X. The builder samples `Lying` by hand every frame at the body's
  breathing rate; stirs, fidgets, twitches and flatline turn the arm, leg, hand and head bones on top.
  `breath_amp` is 0.
- Sites come from the GLB's `Site_*` nodes (bones `forearm.L`, `hips`, `upperarm.R`, `forearm.R`),
  levelled so +Y is straight up; anchors ride those bones. The gunshot is moved from the flank
  (0.62 rad round) to 0.25 rad round the belly so the skin under the forceps patch is nearly level.
  Sections: `limb` half_up 0.0489 / half_side 0.049, `limb_cut` 0.0411 / 0.0384, `shape` 2.2;
  `infection_start` 0.172 and 0.0295.
- The gunshot ailment hides `Human_GownPanel` (a real opening in the gown, not a patch over it).
  While a step has called `expose_site` (the forceps step, round its skin patch) the panel is back
  and the cloth shader (`human_cloth.gdshader`, `expose*` uniforms) discards the gown inside the
  ellipse instead, so gown folds never rise through the patch. Only the panel has skin under it:
  elsewhere the gown is a shell over nothing, so do not expose sites away from the gunshot panel.
  Amputation hides `Human_Forearm_R`; the upper arm's own stump cap shows. `make_severed_limb` bakes
  `Human_Forearm_R` from the current pose (`bake_mesh_from_current_skeleton_pose`), cut cap included.
- `skin_mats` is the model's skin ShaderMaterial (`human_skin.gdshader`): `pallor`, `grey`, `infect`
  (graded by UV2.x, metres along the right arm, from 0.384 to 0.434; the import flips UV2.y, so the
  right arm reads 0 in the shader), plus `gash`, `wound`,
  `vein_glow`. Overlays (tourniquet, stump dressing from `SealModelBuilder.make_stump_dressing`,
  wound, pad and belly band, drips) are fitted to the model.

## Surgery (surgery worker)

```gdscript
# scripts/surgery/surgery_system.gd, a Node the game creates and adds as a child
func setup(game: Node) -> void
func start_case(patient_id: String, ailment_id: String) -> void   # every machine, when a shift begins
func clear_case() -> void
func can_begin(player) -> String      # host: "" if this player may start the current step now, else the reason
func begin(player) -> void            # host: this player becomes the operator
# can_begin's supply check (2026-09-18): the player's selected stack must be the step's item, at
# least `uses` of it (1 for tools). Nothing on shelves or in other slots counts.
# surgery_step_done takes `uses` out of the finishing operator's hands.
func end(player) -> void              # host: operator leaves (step progress is kept)
func physics_tick(delta: float) -> void
func net_state() -> Dictionary        # host -> clients inside the game snapshot
func apply_net_state(s: Dictionary) -> void
func receive_operator_report(peer_id: int, report: Dictionary) -> void   # host
func camera() -> Camera3D             # the camera to render through when the LOCAL player is operating, else null
func wants_mouse() -> bool            # local player is operating and needs a visible cursor
func local_operator_exit() -> void    # local player pressed Esc/E to stop operating
func hud_state() -> Dictionary        # what the HUD draws for the step being watched, or {}
```

Sweep 2 (loop): there is one surgery system per patient table (`game.surgeries`), each with
`var table_index: int` (index into `level_info.tables`) and `end_current()` (the case finished:
the operator steps back). A player operates at one table at a time. `bot_skill` is shared by all
of them (stored as `game.surgery_bot_skill`). `hud_state()` also carries `table`, `step_index`,
`steps`, `vitals`.

Game-side API the surgery system uses:

- `game.case_on_table(table_index)` (the case it operates on while its state is `on_table`) and
  `game.body_for_table(table_index)`; see "Shift loop and patients". `game.case` /
  `game.patient_body` remain as aliases of the first patient case.
- `game.shelf_count(kind)`, `game.is_host()`, `game.world_time`, `game.shift`, `game.players`
- `game.surgery_botch(amount: float, reason: String, table_index := -1)` host: costs that case's
  vitals, says why (-1: the first patient case)
- `game.surgery_step_done(result: Dictionary, table_index := -1, operator_peer := 0)` host: consumes
  the step's items out of `operator_peer`'s hand slots (`Player.consume_hand`), merges
  `result` into the case's flags, gives vitals back, advances; the last step makes the case stable
  (`game.finish_case`)
- `game.send_operator_report(report: Dictionary)` client operator -> host. Every report carries
  `"tb": table_index`; the game routes it to that table's `receive_operator_report` (on the host
  it calls it directly)
- `game.emit_noise(pos, loudness, kind)` host

Minigames extend `scripts/surgery/minigame.gd`; read that file, it is the contract. Parts of it that
are easy to miss:

- `on_jolt(offset, strength, duration)` is called on the operator's machine when an underdosed
  patient stirs; for `duration` seconds the cursor passed to `handle_cursor` carries a decaying
  shake of up to `offset`. React there rather than inferring jolts from cursor jumps.
- **Spending an item mid-step** (2026-09-21): `ctx.hand_count` (Callable(kind) -> int) is what the
  operator holds right now, and `use_item(kind, n)` emits `item_used(kind, n)`. The surgery system
  sends it to the host as an operator report `{"use": [kind, n]}` and the host takes it out of the
  operator's slots (`Player.consume_hand`). The anaesthetic's tourniquet button uses it.
- `ctx.helper_lights` (optional Callable -> Array of SpotLight3D): the surgery system passes the
  flashlights of living players other than the operator. `helper_light()` turns them into
  `{amount, spot}` for this site (on, in range, aimed, clear line of sight). The forceps step lifts
  its channel's darkness with it on every machine.
- `Minigame.OWN_LAYER` (render layer 20) is reserved for a minigame's own props. Decals project
  only onto layer 1, so nothing on layer 20 gets painted. Cameras keep the default cull mask.
- `hud_state()` may add `cross_section: {layers: [{name, from, to, color}], depth, layer}`; the
  surgery HUD draws it as a strip under the gauges (the saw uses it).
`tools/minigame_lab.tscn` runs a single minigame on a stand-in patient, interactively or with its
`bot_input()`, and can take screenshots:
`godot --path . tools/minigame_lab.tscn -- --game=<id> [--patient=bob|seal] [--ailment=...] [--variant=...] [--bot=1.0|0.0] [--seconds=N] [--shot=res://tools/lab_shots/name.png] [--headless-report]`.

## Minigames (minigames worker, sweep 2)

The five steps no longer ask the player to read gauges or match sliders; the patient and the
tool show what is right. Conventions every step follows (and a new one, such as wave 3's
stitches, should too):

- `hud_state()` returns `gauges: []` and one short `hint` line. No step uses `cross_section`
  any more (the HUD still draws it if given).
- **`hud_state()` also returns `keys`** (2026-09-19): `[[key, what it does], ...]`, the controls
  line the surgery HUD draws under the hint, in the panel's teal. Two or three pairs of a couple of
  words each, and they change with the stage, so the strip always says what to do NOW ("HOLD LMB
  grab the eye | MOUSE drag it to the socket"). Override `Minigame.keys()` per stage;
  `E / Esc: step away` is drawn by the HUD itself. Inputs a step can read: the cursor,
  `BUTTON_PRIMARY` (left click), `BUTTON_SECONDARY` (right) and `BUTTON_UP` (**W**, the eye snip's
  "pull the eyeball up"). Bots set the same bits in `bot_input`'s `buttons`. The arcade bits
  (`BUTTON_LEFT` / `RIGHT` / `DOWN` / `ACTION`) are A, D, S and Space, and (2026-09-21)
  `BUTTON_SCROLL_UP` / `BUTTON_SCROLL_DOWN` are one frame each per mouse-wheel notch, and
  `BUTTON_ENTER` (512) is either Enter key, held (the shell's "move on").
- **The shell** (2026-09-21, PANEL_STYLE.md): an `ArcadeGame` with `use_ink()` gets the clipboard, stamp
  cards that wait for a press (the press is the first action), the corner HUD (`hud_line`,
  `hud_value`, `enter_cap`) and `mistake(word, vitals, reason, kind, at, serious)` -- burst, blood,
  shake, the `mistake_made(kind, word)` signal and `cost()` in one call, replicated in the state blob.
- Colour language in the world: **green** = right / holds / grab it now (tourniquet strap and
  pulse probe, gauze path ring and trail, saw guide, forceps reach ring and exit glow);
  **amber** = works but weak (loose wrap, short saw pass, strap too high); **red** = a mistake is
  happening (strap on the infection, rushed or off-line saw, forced wound wall); **purple / grey**
  = too much (tourniquet too tight, overdose). Targets that must never hide (the anesthetic vein,
  the forceps glint and rings) draw with `no_depth_test`.
- Every botch has an in-world cause at the moment it happens (blood spurt, flinch via
  `body.stir`, blanching, slipping strap, unwinding gauze) and a reason string naming it.
- Timings and forgiveness targets, measured with the lab bots: skill 1.0 finishes in about
  8-20 s with 0-2 vitals of botches; skill 0.0 in under 40 s losing about 15-25.
- Stir shakes (`on_jolt`) never cause a botch by themselves except where the design says so
  (gauze: a jolt while winding slips the wrap).
- Forceps `net_state` keys: `x y i j g b st h dm p` plus `w` (0..1 how hard a wall is being
  forced) and `e` (jaws closed on nothing). `h` counts wall tears (each one spurts on every
  machine).
- Each game has a static `self_test()`: `godot --headless --path . tools/minigame_lab.tscn
  --fixed-fps 60 -- --selftest=<game>`. The lab re-places the minigame on the body's site every
  physics frame (as `surgery_system._place_mg` does), `--flags=sedation:0.4` makes stirs, and the
  stump variant defaults to `amputated` so the limb shows off.

## Monsters (monsters worker)

`scripts/monster.gd` keeps this public surface, which the game and the test bot rely on:
`static func new_monster(id: int, kind: String, pos: Vector3) -> CharacterBody3D`,
`static func roster(shift: int, player_count: int) -> Array[String]`,
`enum State { WANDER, CHASE, STUNNED }`, fields `monster_id`, `kind`, `state`, `damage`,
`knockback`, `calm`, `moving`, and methods `alert_to(pos)`, `shoved(dir)`,
`recoil_after_hit()`, `report() -> Dictionary`, `apply_remote(d)`.
Kinds: `"sonographer"` and `"night_nurse"`.

Game-side API for monsters:

- `game.alive_players()`, `game.players`, `game.level_info`, `game.is_host()`
- `game.recent_noises(max_age := 1.5) -> Array` of `{pos: Vector3, loudness: float, kind: String, time: float}`
- `game.monster_hit_player(monster, player)` host
- `game.say(text, seconds)`
- `Perception.is_observed(game, point: Vector3) -> bool` in `scripts/perception.gd` (monsters
  worker): true when some living player has the point inside their camera view with clear
  line of sight AND the point is lit, by any player's flashlight cone or by a ceiling fixture
  that is currently on. Fixtures: `game.level_info["lights"]`, each `{position, mode, node}`
  where `node` is the fixture whose child `OmniLight3D` named `Bulb` carries the live energy.

Noise the game already emits on the host: footsteps (walk 0.25, sprint 0.8), containers 0.5,
pickups 0.15, drops 0.4, breaking glass 0.9, shoves 0.6, surgery monitors 0.6 while someone
operates.

### Monsters, sweep 3 (monsters worker): the Hive, fighting and capturing

Kinds: `Monster.HIVE` `"hive"`, `DISCHARGED`, `NIGHT_NURSE` (`Monster.KINDS`).

```gdscript
static func roster(shift, player_count) -> Array[String]  # Sonographer/Nurse first (MAX_MONSTERS 5), then Hives
static func hive_count(shift, player_count) -> int     # 3 + shift + (players - 1), cap MAX_HIVES 8
static func hive_spots(level_info, count, rng, space = null) -> Array[Vector3]   # game._spawn_monsters uses it
static func is_capturable(kind) -> bool                    # hive, sonographer
static func max_hp_for(kind) -> int                        # hive 2, sonographer 4, night_nurse 0
static func display_name(kind) -> String                   # "Hive", "Sonographer", "Night Nurse"
static func make_lying(kind) -> Node3D                     # = monster_model.gd make_lying (below)
enum State { WANDER, CHASE, STUNNED, SEDATED }             # modes.gd mirrors both enums; append only
enum Mode { IDLE, WANDER, LISTEN, RUSH, SEARCH, STALK, STUNNED, RETREAT, SEDATED }
var hp: int; var max_hp: int
var sedation_left: float      # host only
var dragged_by: int = 0       # set by combat; replicated
var hit_count: int            # bumps (mod 64) on every take_hit; replicated
func can_be_hurt() -> bool                                  # false for the Night Nurse
func take_hit(dir: Vector3, amount: int, source: String) -> String   # host: "stagger" | "killed" | "immune"
func can_sedate() -> bool                                   # capturable, not sedated, mode STUNNED now
func sedate(seconds: float) -> bool                         # host; false for the Nurse / already sedated
func is_sedated() -> bool                                   # every machine (clients read report "sd")
func wake() -> void                                         # host
func eye_transform() -> Transform3D                         # every machine: eyes on the animated head, -Z forward
```

- **take_hit**: hp -= amount; hp 0 returns `"killed"` and does nothing else (the caller calls
  `game.kill_monster(m)`). Otherwise a 0.7 s stagger (mode STUNNED, pushed 0.45 m along `dir`),
  after which it goes for whoever hit it (the nearest player within 3.5 m, else the side the blow
  came from): the Hive walks at them, the Sonographer rushes the spot. A sedated monster takes
  the damage and stays down (`"stagger"`). The Night Nurse returns `"immune"` and nothing changes.
  Any stagger opens `can_sedate()` for its duration, like a shove (2 s).
- **sedate(seconds)**: mode and state SEDATED, the brain stops, it never hits anyone, it does not
  hear or see. On the host it first turns to the facing closest to its current one that leaves
  room to lie down (rays half its height each way), so a body never lies inside a wall. When
  `sedation_left` reaches 0 it calls `wake()`. Players never collide with monsters (their mask is
  the world only), so a sedated monster is not solid to them. Its collision capsule (layer
  `C.L_MONSTER`) lies down with it on every machine: along local Z, centred on the origin.
- **wake()**: stands up over 1.2 s (mode STUNNED), then hunts the nearest player (Hive: walks
  to where they are; Sonographer: rushes them). If `dragged_by` is set it calls
  `game.combat.drop_dragged(dragger)` when combat has it, clears `dragged_by`, and hits the dragger
  (`game.monster_hit_player`) when they are within 3 m. Combat should not hit them a second time.
- **dragged_by != 0**: the brain does not think (host); every machine sets the monster's position
  to `game.combat.monster_pin(m).origin` and its yaw to the pin's -Z each physics frame when
  combat has `monster_pin` (otherwise clients keep interpolating the snapshot). The pin's tilt is
  ignored. The lying body is centred on the monster's origin along its local Z axis, head toward
  local **+Z** (behind its former facing), face up, about 0.13 m off the floor: a pin whose -Z
  points away from the dragger drags it head first.
- **The lying pose** plays on every machine from mode SEDATED (report `sd`): the model tips over
  backwards and settles in about 0.6 s; it gets up in about 0.9 s when `sd` clears.
- **Report** (`Monster.report`) adds `sd` (bool), `db` (peer id), `hc` (hit counter). `hp` and
  `sedation_left` stay on the host. Clients flinch and play `monsters_flesh_hit` when `hc` changes.
- **make_lying(kind)** (`scripts/monsters/monster_model.gd`, static): a still copy lying on its back
  along X, head toward -X, face up (+Y), origin at the middle of its back (the PatientBody
  convention). Lengths: Hive about 1.7 m, Sonographer about 1.8 m (neck at rest). Rig-less
  fallback: primitives. Its node named `Head` follows the head bone. It keeps an AnimationPlayer
  frozen on the idle pose; do not free the skeleton. The shaper's optional cfg `lying_spread`
  (degrees, default 11) sets how far the arms lie out from the sides.
- **The Hive**: sight only (110 degree cone, 12 m, rays to the player's head then chest, walls
  block, light does not matter; 5 Hz, staggered; the ray count is in `brain.rays`). Wanders 0.8 m/s
  within 7 m of where it spawned, chases at 1.8 m/s straight at whoever it sees, keeps walking to
  the last sighting for up to 2.5 s after losing them, looks around about 3 s, gives up. Ignores
  every noise; `alert_to(pos)` sends it to look at `pos`. Hits for 1 on contact, then backs off
  and stays calm 4 s. Shove: 2 s stun. Height about 1.75 m, collision radius 0.36.
- **The Sonographer** (`sonographer_brain.gd`, docs/SONOGRAPHER.md chunk B, 2026-09-18): about 1.8 m
  with the neck at rest (collision capsule 1.85 m, radius 0.36), blind. Modes, in order:
  WANDER / IDLE 1.4 m/s, **LISTEN** (stops dead 0.8-1.2 s, head cocked), **CHARGE** (1.2 s),
  **ECHO** (0.35 s), RUSH 5.2 m/s, **WAIL**, SEARCH 1.1 m/s, STUNNED, RETREAT, SEDATED.
  `Monster.Mode` and `modes.gd` gained `CHARGE`, `ECHO`, `WAIL` (appended; the ints cross the wire).
  - **Suspicion** `brain.suspicion` 0..1. **The neck is the meter** -- there is no HUD for it. Every
    noise under `LOUD` (0.8) adds `loudness * (0.35 + 0.65 * closeness) * SUSP_GAIN` (1.6) and it
    drains at 0.06/s. Full: it LISTENs out its timer, then CHARGEs and ECHOes. A noise at 0.8 or
    louder adds nothing and makes it **certain** instead: after the listen it rushes straight there,
    spending no echo.
  - **The echo** fires from the wand (`model.echo_origin()`, not the head) toward what it heard:
    a wedge `ECHO_ARC` 60 degrees wide and `ECHO_RANGE` 14 m long, `ECHO_PITCH` 28 degrees off the
    horizontal. Walls and **closed doors** block it (`clear_line`, `C.L_WORLD`). Later shifts and
    deeper wings **sweep**: `brain.sweep` 0..1 (from `game.shift` and the distance from the
    entrance, worked out once at spawn) widens the fan by up to `SWEEP_EXTRA` 110 degrees.
    `brain.in_echo(origin, dir, point)` is the test; `brain.echo_beam()` is where it fires from.
  - **Imaged**: every player the wedge catches goes into `brain.imaged` (peer -> {pos, t}) and into
    the event; the echo then empties the meter and it RUSHes the **nearest** imaged player's imaged
    position. `scripts/monsters/sono_echo.gd` (child `SonoEcho` of Game, every machine) draws the
    grainy fan and, for a caught local player, flashes ultrasound grain over their screen and
    **deafens** them: a capped, ramped squeal (`monsters_sono_squeal`, `SQUEAL_DB` -9, setting
    `soft_squeal` takes it to -19) with `Audio.set_deafen()` muffling everything else for about
    1.25 s. **The squeal must never hurt a real player's ears.**
  - **The wail**: contact starts it (`brain.start_wail`, from `recoil_after_hit`) instead of the old
    retreat. Bursts of `WAIL_BURST` 1.1 s with a `WAIL_PAUSE` 0.85 s **listening pause** between
    them, a blow every `WAIL_HIT_EVERY` 0.85 s. It chases where it last **heard** them, not where
    they are, so going quiet for `LOSE_QUIET` 3 s shakes it off; a shove clears the quarry; a downed
    player ends it (it does not finish them off) and it goes back to hunting. With nobody standing
    in reach, a blow still leaves it in RETREAT and calm for `CALM_AFTER_HIT` 5 s.
  - **The ceiling check** (`Monster._headroom`, every machine, 4 Hz): a ray up from the head's rest
    height feeds `crane_limit` to `set_sono_look`, so under a low ceiling the neck bends forward
    instead of going through it.
  - **Sounds**: `monsters_sono_click` (faster with suspicion) and `monsters_sono_step` while it
    walks, both silent while it listens, charges or echoes; `monsters_sono_charge`,
    `monsters_sono_ping` (at the wand), `monsters_sono_rush`, `monsters_sono_wail`,
    `monsters_sono_squeal`. All in `tools/gen_audio_monsters.mjs`.
  - **Networking**: `report()` appends `ss` (suspicion) and `sc` (charge), both quantized to 1/64,
    so a client's neck and charge match the host's. The echo itself is the reliable event
    `sn_echo {id, o, d, h, r, pk}` (origin, direction, half-angle, reach, the peers it caught),
    routed in `game._event` by its `sn_` prefix to `game.sono_echo`. `Monster._sono_visual` works
    the clip, the aim and the headroom out locally, so nothing else needs replicating.
  - `MonsterModel.set_ears(listen, yaw, delta)` swivels its ears toward `listen_yaw`. Its kind id is
    `sonographer` (`brain_sonographer`, Brains path `sonographer`, database key `sonographer`); old
    saves' `discharged` database page loads as it (`database_store.gd`).
- **Placement** (`hive_spots`, host): hallway tiles (`.`/`M`, outside every room rect grown by a
  tile, not in a doorway's mouth) of each wing (`zone_of` == the wing id), at least 5 m from the
  entrance building and within 12 m of the wing's shallowest such tile; blocked tiles rejected
  with a sphere query when a physics space is given. Groups of 2-3 (4 when there are more
  Hives than wings can take), one group per wing while wings last, each within 3.5 m of a
  random shallow centre. Levels without `wings`/`zones`/`entrance_rect` (dev room, lab) group
  them around `monster_spawns`.
- **Shapes.bake(root, key)**: every part added through `MonsterModel.add_part` is merged into one
  mesh per material, cached per kind and part for the session (a Hive went from about 90 draw
  calls to about 6). Parts that move on their own must carry meta `no_bake` (the ears).
- Sounds (`tools/gen_audio_monsters.mjs`): `monsters_hive_groan` (occasional, and when it first
  sees someone), `monsters_hive_shuffle` (per step), `monsters_flesh_hit` (any struck monster),
  `monsters_hive_death` (played by the dev room's `monster_died_fx` for a Hive),
  `monsters_sedated_breath` (every 3-4 s near a sedated monster).
- Tests: `tools/monster_lab.tscn` (headless scenarios 1-10: hearing, darkness, the Nurse, contact,
  roster, client mirrors, the Hive, hits/sedation/waking, dragging/lying copies, placement over
  generated hospitals), `-- --shots` (windowed close-ups into `tools/monster_shots/`), `-- --perf`
  (Hive frame cost, windowed; `-- --perf --nurses`: 0, 1 and 4 Night Nurses in view), `-- --real`
  (a bot in a generated hospital), and the nettest scenario `monsters`.

### The Night Nurse's model (2026-09-14)

Asset `monster/night_nurse` (`assets/models/monsters/night_nurse/`, built in Blender from
`art/night_nurse/`, see `ASSETS.md`): 2.30 m, feet at y 0, faces -Z after the registry's yaw 180,
clips `Idle`, `Walk` (in place, no root motion), `Frozen`. `MonsterModel.setup("night_nurse")` builds
it through `scripts/monsters/night_nurse_rig.gd`; without the asset she falls back to the reshaped
Kenney rig and `night_nurse_look.gd` (unchanged).

```gdscript
model.nurse                  # NursePoser (SkeletonModifier3D) or null; lunge, recoil, slump, sit, hold, grab, cock
model.rig / skeleton / anim  # the GLB's root, Skeleton3D and AnimationPlayer (the lab and tests read anim)
model.play(logical, rate, blend)   # "idle" Idle, "walk"/"run"/"attack" Walk, "frozen"/"static" Frozen
model.hand_point(left)       # the hand.L / hand.R bone, world
model.eye_offset()           # eyes in the Head node's frame: (0, 0.134, 0.079) for her, (0, 0.13, 0.1) the rig looks
NurseRig.WALK_SPEED 1.0      # m/s at which Walk's planted foot keeps pace; rate = speed / WALK_SPEED
```

- A `BoneAttachment3D` named `Head` rides her head bone (`Monster.eye_transform`, the lab's head shots).
- `Monster._nurse_visual` (every machine, from the report): watched (`ob`) stops the clip on its frame
  (`anim.speed_scale = 0`) and holds every pose; moving (or lunging) plays Walk at `speed / WALK_SPEED`
  (0.3..4x) with the model lifted `WALK_LIFT` 3.5 cm; lunging adds the `lunge` reach; a calm that starts
  outside a retreat (a dev gun knock-down) throws her back (`recoil`, 0.6 s) and then holds `Frozen`
  while she stands down; otherwise Idle. Footstep squeaks follow the clip (0.8 s / speed).
- She never lies down, is never dragged, sedated or strapped (sweep 3 locked design), so she has no
  lying or dissection body. `make_lying("night_nurse")` returns her rest pose if anyone asks.
- The dev room's corpse (`dev_gun.gd monster_corpse`) shows her `Frozen` pose with `slump` 1.

### The Night Nurse's grab (2026-09-18)

Her contact takes no hearts: she grabs. One timeline (`scripts/monsters/nurse_grab.gd`) every machine
plays from `Monster.grab_t`, which each machine counts itself from the moment the host's `gp` names a
victim:

| t (s) | what happens |
|---|---|
| 0 .. `REACH` 0.08 | both her hands snap round the victim's throat; she straightens to her full height (legs, hips, spine, neck straight), elbows bowed out |
| 0 .. `LIFT` 0.24 | the victim comes up off the spot they stood on, to her face (overshoots, settles) |
| .. `SNAP_AT` 1.1 | her head faces them straight on; the victim's camera is locked on her face |
| `SNAP_AT` + `SNAP` 0.07 | her head snaps over to one side, cocked (`dissection_crack`, a camera jolt) |
| `DROP_AT` 2.0 | she lets go: the victim drops, downed, where they were taken; she vanishes |

```gdscript
# Monster (scripts/monster.gd)
m.grab_peer: int            # peer id she holds, 0 nobody; host authoritative, report key "gp"
m.grab_t: float             # seconds into the grab; every machine counts it (reset when gp changes)
m.start_grab(p) / m.end_grab()      # host (game.nurse_grab / the brain)
m.grab_victim_pose(p) -> Transform3D   # where the held victim hangs: from her grip, facing her
# Player (scripts/player.gd)
p.held_by: int              # the Nurse's monster id, -1 nobody; report_full "nh"; pinned to game.pinned_pose
p.held_from: Vector3        # where she took them (recorded on every machine); they drop back onto it
p.grabber() -> Node         # that Nurse, on this machine
# Game (scripts/game.gd)
game.nurse_grab(m, p) -> bool   # host: Monster.try_contact calls it for her instead of monster_hit_player;
                                # refuses the downed, held, carried, tabled, invulnerable and god mode
game.nurse_drop(m, p)           # host, at DROP_AT: teleport to held_from, knock_down_player "monster:night_nurse"
# The pose (night_nurse_rig.gd, on top of the frozen clip)
model.nurse.grab / cock     # 0..1 from NurseGrab.reach(t) / cock(t)
model.nurse.grip_world      # the throat she holds (world), recorded inside the modifier; ZERO when not
model.nurse.grab_wrists     # [right, left] wrists (world), for the lab
# The victim's body (body_poser.gd, generic human rigs)
poser.dangle / dangle_t     # hanging: arms limp at the sides, legs limp and kicking weakly, head back
```

- While she holds someone her brain ignores being watched (`observed` stays false) and she does not
  move; the clip stops dead (`anim.speed_scale 0`) and the pose does everything.
- The victim can do nothing (every action is refused, E does not call for help, the first-person hands
  hide); nothing else can hurt them (`monster_hit_player` skips the held); Hive Eyes ends; whatever they
  held drops and whoever they carried falls, as a hit would.
- She vanishes (`NurseBrain._vanish`) to a random navigation point at least `VANISH_MIN` 22 m from every
  living surgeon and out of everyone's light (the farthest candidate if none qualifies), calm for
  `VANISH_CALM` 5 s. Clients snap monsters that jump more than 6 m, so she is simply gone.
- `kill_monster` on a Nurse mid-grab drops her victim, unhurt, where they were taken.
- Tests: `tools/monster_lab.tscn` scenario 3 (the grab, the lift, the wrists on the neck, held while
  watched, the head snap, the drop, the vanish) and scenario 6 (a client copy plays it from `gp`); shots
  `nurse_grab_stare`, `nurse_grab_cocked` (the victim's view), `nurse_grab_side`,
  `nurse_grab_side_cocked`, `nurse_grab_hands`, `nurse_grab_hands_back`.

### The Hive's model (2026-09-18)

Asset `monster/hive` (`assets/models/monsters/hive/`, built in Blender from `art/stylized/`, variant
`hive`, see `ASSETS.md`): 1.75 m, feet at y 0, faces -Z after the registry's yaw 180, the human
skeleton, clips `HiveIdle`, `HiveWalk` (0.85 m/s, in place), `HiveAttack` (one-shot).
`MonsterModel.setup("hive")` builds it through `scripts/monsters/hive_rig.gd`; without the asset it
falls back to the reshaped Kenney rig and `hive_look.gd` (unchanged).

```gdscript
model.hive                   # HivePoser (SkeletonModifier3D) or null; it is also model.shaper
model.shaper.lying / daze / rise / stagger / twitch   # the rig_shaper inputs monster.gd and the stun window set
model.hive.lock              # 0..1: the head comes up to look at model.hive.look_target (world), eyes fully lit
model.play(logical, rate, blend)   # "idle" HiveIdle, "walk"/"run" HiveWalk, "attack" HiveAttack
model.eye_offset()           # eyes in the Head node's frame, read from the GLB's Site_eyes
HiveRig.WALK_SPEED 0.85      # rate = speed / WALK_SPEED (0.4..2.4x)
```

- A node named `Head` rides the head bone, turned so its axes are the model's at rest (+Y up, +Z the
  face): `Monster.eye_transform`, Hive Eyes.
- `Monster._hive_visual` (every machine, from the report): RUSH raises `lock` (0 -> 1 in a third of a
  second, back down over a second and a bit); the look target is the nearest standing player within
  14 m in front of it, at eye height, so clients need nothing extra replicated. The eyes
  (`shaders/hive_eye.gdshader`) glow a pinpoint at `lock` 0 and flood orange at 1, with a small omni
  light on the face; sedated, the eyes go back to the pinpoint.
- Lying (sedated, dragged, `make_lying`): the poser eases every bone back to rest and brings the arms
  in to the sides. On the OR table (`monster_builder.gd _build_st`) the body is strapped down with its
  fungus showing; the dissection head that opens is built hidden, only to place the `skull`, `brain`
  and `injection` sites, since the Hive has no brain (harvest waits on the grafting redesign).

### The Sonographer's model (2026-09-18, chunk A of docs/SONOGRAPHER.md)

The model only: the hunting, the echo, the rename and the sounds are chunk B (`sono-brain`). Asset
`monster/sonographer` (`assets/models/monsters/sonographer/`, built in Blender from `art/stylized/`,
variant `sonographer`, clips `art/stylized/st_sono_clips.py`): a standalone model, no cart, about
1.8 m at rest and 2.7 m craned, feet at y 0. `MonsterModel.setup("sonographer")` builds it through
`scripts/monsters/sonographer_rig.gd`; without the asset it falls back to the reshaped Kenney rig.

**The neck is the suspicion meter.** The shared skeleton's one neck bone is cut into a chain of four
(`neck`, `neck2`, `neck3`, `neck4`; `st_build.add_neck_bones`) and the rig stretches that chain by up
to `SonoRig.CRANE_M` (0.9 m) as `suspicion` rises, unfolding it out of its slight stoop as it goes.
At rest the neck is an ordinary length, so all of that is new length: the first time you see it
longer than a person's is when it starts to grow. The windpipe and the see-through skin over it are
weighted along the same chain, so the glowing windpipe stretches out along it and the throat burns
brighter. **No clip ever stretches it**: every clip poses the neck with only a slight stoop and the
crane is a 0..1 blend laid on top, eased so it rises quickly and sinks slowly. This is the only place
the Sonographer leaves the shared skeleton, and it stops at the neck.

**The look interface.** The whole surface between the model and whatever drives it, so a stand-in can
wear it too and whichever chunk merges second hooks them together:

```gdscript
model.set_sono_look(suspicion, charge, mode, aim, crane_limit)
#   suspicion   0..1  the neck cranes with it and the throat glows brighter
#   charge      0..1  the charge pose, and the glow coming on in the throat and then the wand
#   mode              which clip family is playing: idle, wander, suspicious, charging, echo, rush,
#                     wail, search, stagger, lying
#   aim               the world direction the probe points while it charges and echoes
#   crane_limit 0..1  how far the neck may stretch up before it bends forward instead. 1 is open
#                     sky; below 1 it trades height for reach, so the head never goes up through a
#                     ceiling. The brain does the raycast, the model just obeys the number.
model.echo_origin()          # Transform3D at the probe's tip, -Z the way the wand points: an echo
                             # fires from the probe, not from the head or the chest
model.sono                   # SonoPoser (SkeletonModifier3D) or null; it is also model.shaper
model.sono.crane()           # 0..1, what the neck is actually doing this frame
model.shaper.lying / daze / rise / stagger / twitch / listen / listen_yaw   # the usual rig_shaper inputs
model.set_ears(listen, yaw, delta)   # the two ears swivel, as the Sonographer's do
model.play(logical, rate, blend)
#   "idle" SonoIdle, "walk" SonoWander (0.8 m/s), "run" SonoRush (3.1 m/s), "attack" SonoWail,
#   "listen" SonoListen, "charge" SonoCharge, "echo" SonoEcho, "search" SonoSearch,
#   "stagger" SonoStagger, "lying" SonoLying
SonoRig.WANDER_SPEED 0.80 / RUSH_SPEED 3.10    # rate = speed / the clip's speed
```

`set_sono_look` is safe on any model: every other look ignores it.

- **The pieces.** The ears (`Human_Ear_L` / `_R`) come off the skin at load and hang under pivots at
  `Site_ear_L` / `_R` in the model's own axes, so they turn. The windpipe (`Human_Throat`) gets
  `shaders/sono_glow.gdshader` in violet (`#9b6bff`, matching `art/icons/echolocation.svg`) plus a
  cold omni light; the skin over it (`Human_ThroatSkin`) is translucent, and **nothing covers the
  throat**: the collar is open and the tie pulled loose. The wand fitted to the cut right wrist
  (`Human_Probe`) shares the same shader: the charge lights the throat and then the wand. There is
  no cable. The gel drips (`Human_Gel_*`) are their own pieces, and the skin gets a glossy copy of
  its baked material, because the wet gel is what the flashlight catches. The ears are ordinary
  ears grown into the head (their skin matches it), so nothing about them reads as separate.
- **Posture.** Tall and thin, a slight stoop, head cocked a little. At rest the neck is an ordinary
  length; the crane (up to 0.9 m) is all new length. The right arm has no hand (the wand is fitted to
  the wrist): it hangs and sways, rises to point, and clubs. The left hand is long-fingered
  and spread, feeling the air.
- **Lying** (sedated, dragged, `make_lying`): the poser eases every bone back to rest, which takes
  the neck back to rest length, and brings the arms in to its sides.
- Review: **`tools/sono_lab.tscn`** is the stage for it: a plain lit box with the Sonographer in
  front of a fixed camera, head to toe with headroom for the craned neck, cycling every clip in
  place with a caption naming it and the look interface's values, walking a little to each side
  between rounds. Nothing in it waits on the hospital, a player or a warmup, so it is in frame from
  the first frame; `-- --capture` writes what the window is actually showing at 5, 15, 30, 45 and
  60 s. `tools/monster_lab.tscn -- --sono` still walks it through the clips in the corridor, and the
  shots `sono_4m`, `sono_wander`, `sono_crane_0`,
  `sono_crane_half`, `sono_crane_full`, `sono_crane_ceiling`, `sono_charge`, `sono_probe`,
  `sono_rush`, `sono_wail`, `sono_search`, `sono_throat`, `sono_face` and `sono_lying` are in
  `--shots`.

## Database terminal (terminal redesign, 2026-09-16: the break room projector screen)

The guide binder, the desk computer, its E prompt and `main.terminal_ui` are gone. The database is
a pull-down projector screen in the break room (`scripts/database/wall_terminal.gd`, placed on the
reserved lectern spot through `terminal_model.gd make_terminal()`), public: everyone sees the same
page, anyone can click it, and signing in only decides whose database fills the cards.

```gdscript
# wall_terminal.gd: the screen, projector and SubViewport (1280x720)
func set_on(on) / func pixel_at(world_point) -> Vector2 / func point(px) / func click(px) / func clear_pointer()
# wall_terminal_ui.gd: the drill-down drawn into it
var page: Dictionary   # {kind: "home"} | {kind: "section", id, index} | {kind: "entry", section, key}
func history() -> Array / func set_view(page, history) / func refresh()
func sign_rect() -> Rect2 / func set_hold(k) / func set_remote_cursors(points) / func pulse(px)
func link_at(px) -> String / func open_link(key)
# wall_pages.gd: content; view = wall_session.view()
static func entries(section, view) -> Array   # [{key, title, known}]
static func page(section, key, view) -> Dictionary
# wall_session.gd (game.wall): who is signed in, the shared page, clicks and lasers
var user: int                          # signed-in peer, 0 for nobody
func view() -> Dictionary              # {db: {kind: bits 1 sighted 2 scanned 4 harvested}, peer, brains}
func click(px) / func sign_in() / func sign_out() / func own_db_changed()
func laser_of(player) -> Dictionary    # {from, to, landed, terminal, px}
```

- **Driving it:** R is always a laser (`scan_fx.gd`). On the screen its dot is the cursor (hover is
  local to each machine); a left click while scanning (`Player.laser_clicks`) goes to
  `game.wall.click(px)`. The host pushes the click into its own viewport, so Buttons only ever press
  on the host; a guest sends `_rpc_wall("click", {px, link})`, `link` being the tool its own turntable
  had under the dot (each machine turns its own). Everyone sees a click's ring (event "wt_pulse").
- **Pages:** HOME is 2x2 cards (Monsters, Procedures, Surgery Items, Other Items); a section is 3x3
  cards with PREV/NEXT; "???" cards (monsters not scanned, other items never picked up) can't open.
  An entry has a header, subtitle, short paragraphs (a monster's ability and 3 levels; a procedure's
  steps as a numbered paragraph) and its 3D model turning on the right (`model_preview.gd`). A
  procedure's tools on the turntable are links: pointed at, the name shows over it; clicked, it opens
  the surgery item. BACK goes up one page, HOME to the top.
- **Signing in:** holding left click on HOLD TO SIGN IN for `HOLD_SECONDS` (1.5, timed in
  `scan_fx.gd` with `Player.laser_held`) signs that player in: their machine sends its database
  (`_rpc_wall("sign_in", {db})`), and every change to it while signed in (`game.mark_own_db` ->
  `own_db_changed`). Only one player at a time. Signed out by SIGN OUT (a click), walking
  `WALK_AWAY_M` (9 m) from the screen, leaving, or `IDLE_SECONDS` (60) with nobody's laser on the
  screen; signing out goes HOME. Ability levels read `game.brains.level(user, path)` (replicated).
- **Net:** global snapshot fields "wt" {p: page, h: history}, "wu" user, "wd" the user's database
  bits, "pj" the projector; a player's `scan_holding` travels in `report_full` ("sh") so every
  machine draws everyone's laser (from their flashlight, along their view) and their dot on the
  screen, with no extra traffic.

### The database (host-authoritative, saved to disk)

```gdscript
# scripts/database/db_record.gd
class DbRecord { kind, sighted, scanned, harvested }
func to_dict() -> Dictionary / func from_dict(d: Dictionary) -> void
# scripts/database/database_store.gd
static func load_into(database: Dictionary) -> void   # user://database.save -> kind -> DbRecord
static func save(database: Dictionary) -> void
# game.gd
game.database: Dictionary            # kind -> DbRecord: THIS machine's player's own, loaded once in Game._ready()
game.db_record(kind) -> DbRecord      # creates one on first touch
game.mark_db(kind, field)             # host: sets a field true (once), saves to disk, and
    # broadcasts "db_update" {kind, field} so every client's own mirror of `database` (used only
    # by its terminal) stays current. A client's terminal calls game.request_database_sync() on
    # open, which asks the host (any_peer rpc `_rpc_request_database`) for a one-off full copy
    # ("db_full" event) -- there is no continuous replication of the database.
```

- `mark_db` is what `game._tick_scan` (sighted/scanned), `dissection.on_case_finished` (a won
  monster case: harvested) and `brains.drink` (an absorbed brain: harvested) call. It is not
  cleared by `reset_money()` (a wipe): species knowledge is meant to survive a wipe, and
  `DatabaseStore.save`/`load_into` make it survive a full reload too.
- A guest's scan or harvest is recorded exactly like the host's own: `_tick_scan` and the
  dissection/brains hooks are already host-only and iterate every player (`alive_players()`),
  so whichever peer is aiming or holding the brain, the record it changes is `game.database` on
  the host. Guests never keep their own copy; their terminal only ever shows a fetched mirror.

## Hospital (hospital worker, sweep 2 wave 1)

`MapGen.generate(seed)` (`scripts/mapgen.gd`, parts in `scripts/level/`) lays out one floor:
an entrance building (the hub, 33 x 33 tiles since the 2026-09-16 hub rebuild, after Zach's floorplan:
hallway, spine, OR with its supply storage closet, lab wall and lab storage bay, crematorium with the furnace built
into its wall, break room, personnel, waiting room, lobby, pharmacy, vestibule; see the header of
`scripts/level/entrance.gd`), exactly three wings around it (`west`, `north`, `east`) and the
neutral area outside the main doors. `HospitalBuilder.build(gen, info)` builds it and fills
`info`. Maps without furniture data (hand-made tile maps, `tools/monster_lab.gd`) go through
`scripts/level/legacy_builder.gd` with the old keys only.

Tiles: `#` wall, `.` indoor floor, `+` doorway, `,` outdoor ground, `=` the fence, `P` player
spawn, `T` tool spawn, `M` monster spawn. Walkable: `. + , P T M`. Every doorway has a door (see
"Doors and the per-shift wings" below): one tile wide for most rooms, two for the cafeteria,
radiology and the morgue (double doors); the nurse station and the waiting room keep archways.
Since the doors sweep the entrance building sits at a fixed tile origin (`MapGen.ENTRANCE_ORIGIN`,
32, 34) on a fixed 92 x 74 map for every seed, and `MapGen.generate(run_seed, wing_seed)` lays out
the wings from their own seed.

`level_info`, world metres, +Y up; positions are on the floor unless noted:

```gdscript

# a function of neutral_rect -- no new key needed for it). The ambulance is a driven vehicle
# (scripts/loop/shift_loop.gd / scripts/loop/ambulance.gd), not a parked prop, so `ambulance` is

# to change. The shop's van is gone, so the shop interactable moved into the lobby space chunk 3

ambulance: {position (the bay, where paramedics get out), yaw (faces the doors), lane_start: Vector3 (deep in the fog, where it drives from/to)}

```

- Room kinds: `or`, `or_storage`, `or_lab`, `hub_crematorium`, `break_room`, `hub_personnel`,
  `hub_waiting`, `lobby`, `hub_pharmacy` (wing `"entrance"`, depth 0, `Entrance.ROOM_KINDS`) and `patient_room`, `supply_closet`, `pharmacy`, `nurse_station`, `waiting_room`,
  `restroom`, `office`, `lab`, `radiology`, `morgue`, `janitor_closet`, `cafeteria`. Anchors and
  containers outside rooms report `room_kind` `"corridor"` (wing hallways), `"entrance"` or
  `"neutral"`.
- Deeper wings are bigger (depth is ordered by area), darker (`MapGen.LIGHTS_WING`: fewer steady
  fixtures, more dead ones) and get more of the needed supply. The OR's fixtures are always on
  and brighter; entrance fixtures are mostly steady.
- Furniture is data (`gen.furniture`: kind, tile-space position, yaw, room), sized in
  `scripts/level/piece_defs.gd` and drawn by `scripts/level/piece_factory.gd` (Assets model or
  primitive) as MultiMeshes per 12-tile chunk. Pieces that `block` fill their tiles (the
  navigation mesh leaves them out). Other pieces only get a collider when they stand against a
  wall; a chair or plant in the open has none, so agents on the navigation mesh never snag.
  Wall corners have chamfered colliders.
- Monsters are placed only on wing hallways, but they still wander anywhere on the navigation
  mesh (`Monster.random_nav_point`). Keeping them out of the entrance or the neutral area is the
  loop's call (`zone_of` tells where a position is).
- Tests: `tools/mapcheck.gd` (hundreds of seeds: `MapGen.validate` plus builds with contract keys,
  navigation coverage, paths from the neutral area to the OR and every wing, every container and
  anchor in reach), `tools/spawncheck.gd`, and windowed screenshots with
  `godot --path . tools/hospitalshot.tscn --resolution 1280x720 -- --seed=N [--only=a,b]`.

### Pocket spaces (pockets worker, docs/POCKET_SPACES.md)

A map (each shift's wings) rolls 0-1 pocket space (`PocketPlan.CHANCE` 0.5; about 40% of seeds end up with one): **the Factory**
or **the Restaurant**, built far from the hospital (world tile origin `PocketSpaces.ORIGINS`: factory
(800, 0), restaurant (800, 500)) with 2-3 entrances into at least two different wings, deeper wings more
likely. Code in `scripts/level/pockets/`: `pocket_plan.gd` (generation), `stub.gd` (an entrance, its frame
and its pocket-side copy), `pocket_spaces.gd` (runtime, `game.pockets`), `pocket_common.gd`,
`factory.gd`, `restaurant.gd`.

```gdscript

```

- **Per shift** (doors contract, `scripts/level/wing_loader.gd`): the plan is rolled with the wings, so
  every shift's wings may bring a different pocket, other entrances or none. `teardown_wings` (from the
  loader's teardown, after its own eviction) puts players and bots standing in the pocket or in a
  hospital-side stub (zone 10, which the loader does not see) in front of that wing's gate (a client:
  `dr_evict`), removes monsters and items in there (host), and frees the old nodes a few at a time.
  `build_wings` runs the layout, the surface arrays and the navigation bake on a WorkerThreadPool
  task, then the node steps within `FRAME_BUDGET_MS` (5 ms) per frame; the pocket root is a child of
  `info.wings_root`. A whole level build (`game._build_level`) and `begin_shift` call `finish_now()`.
  While `busy`: `game.clock_in` waits (as for the wings), `doors._wings_ready()` is false (gates stay
  locked), `pocket` is `{}` and nothing crosses.
- **Doors**: the pockets' own doorways get doors from `scripts/doors/door.gd` (plan entries from
  `PocketCommon.door_entry`, ids `dr_<x>_<y>` in world tiles, `base` false, `pocket` true), registered
  with `game.doors` when the build finishes and dropped by `doors.unregister_wings()`: the Factory's
  three site offices (hinged, hung at the hall face), the Restaurant's kitchen (a `double` pair), back
  corridor and two restrooms (hinged), each under a lintel at `HospitalBuilder.LINTEL_Y`
  (`PocketCommon.lintels`). Entrance stubs never get a door.
- **An entrance** is a U-shaped hallway stub carved into one or two neighbouring room slots of a wing
  (stub-local tiles `u` 0..w-1 along the slot, `v` 0..d-1 away from the hallway; leg 1 at u 0..1 opens
  onto the hallway at v -1, leg 2 runs along the back, leg 3 at u w-2..w-1; `Stub.size_ok`: w >= 8 and
  `d - 2 - 4 / ((w - 4) / 2) >= 0.5`). The seam is the plane s = w / 2 across leg 2. The pocket copy is
  built from the same tiles in hospital coordinates under a Node3D with transform `t` (same vertices,
  UVs, materials, fixture seeds), on render layer bit `Stub.COPY_LAYER_BIT` (11), lit by its own
  fixtures and copies of the hospital fixtures within reach of the stub (fixtures cast no shadows);
  those lights leave out `Stub.POCKET_LAYER_BIT` (12), the layer of every pocket surface and prop, and
  pocket lights leave out the copy layer. Bodies, items and first-person hands stay on their own layers
  and are lit by both. Leg 3 opens into the pocket through its outer wall.
- **Crossing**: anything standing past the seam in its copy's unwalked half (hospital copy: s >= w/2;
  pocket copy: s < w/2) is moved through `t` / `t_inv`, keeping position relative to the stub,
  velocity and facing (players: `_yaw`, `bot_yaw`, `_knock`; monsters: `_target_*`, `_repath`; loose
  unfrozen items: transform and velocities). The local player and host bots move on their own
  machine; monsters and items on the host. A carried player and a dragged monster are re-pinned in the
  same frame. Remote players, monsters and items that jump more than 6 m between snapshots snap
  instead of lerping (`player.gd`, `monster.gd`, `world_item.gd`). The host accepts a client's position
  as always (no check).
- **Navigation**: the hospital's stub tiles past the seam are `blocked` (left out of its navigation
  mesh); the pocket bakes its own region (unwalked halves left out) and each seam has a bidirectional
  `NavigationLink3D` (travel cost about 1 m). `Monster.nav_move` maps the target with `real_point` and
  the next path point with `steer_point`, so a chase paths into the pocket, walks across the seam and
  continues; the test bots do the same.
- **level_info**: `pockets` = `{kind, rect, origin, spawn, wing, depth, seams: [{id, wing, depth, w, d,
  hospital, pocket, transform, mouth, opening, link}], nav_region}` (`{}` without a pocket); the pocket's
  `lights` (fixtures: node with a Bulb OmniLight3D), `containers`, `loose_anchors` (wing = the deepest
  connected wing, depth its depth; room kinds `factory_floor`, `factory_office`, `factory_catwalk`,
  `restaurant`, `restaurant_kitchen`) and `monster_spawns` are appended to the hospital's lists.
- **Air**: inside a pocket, away from its openings, `game.pockets` blends the environment's depth fog,
  volumetric fog density and ambient light toward `PocketSpaces.AIR[kind]` and back.
- **Mirrors**: players and monsters inside a stub are also drawn in the other copy (RenderingServer
  instances of their meshes, skeletons attached); `Perception.observed_any` checks the mirrored points
  too.
- Tests: `tools/mapcheck.gd` (every seed again with a pocket forced, on shift 1-4 wing seeds: plan, stub tiles, seams tile for tile
  both ways, pocket grid reachability, door swings; builds: navigation into the pocket and out through each seam,
  containers and anchors in reach), `tools/pockettest.tscn` (also the next shift's rebuild; `-- --frames` windowed
  frame times), `tools/looptest.tscn -- --pocket=factory`, nettest `pockets` (also the next shift's rebuild on every
  machine), `tools/gameshot.tscn --
  --pocket=factory|restaurant`, `tools/perfprobe.tscn -- --pockets`, devtest's pocket panel checks.

## Settings (settings worker, sweep 2)

`Settings` autoload (`scripts/settings.gd`, registered after `Audio`), persisted to
`user://settings.cfg` (section `settings`):

- Anything new that should follow a setting reads `get_value()` when built and connects
  `changed`; do not write the config file yourself.
- Buses (`default_bus_layout.tres`): `Master`, `Hall` (reverb, -> Master), `Music` (-> Hall),
  `SFX` (-> Master), `Ambience` (-> SFX). New sounds go through `Audio.play()` (SFX bus); a
  player of your own must use bus `"SFX"` (or `"Music"`) so the volume settings reach it.
- `Look.apply_brightness(target, v)` bends the colour-grade ramp (a gamma on its input, keeping
  the shipped hue) and moves tonemap exposure by up to a quarter stop. 0.5 restores the shipped
  ramp and exposure 1.0 exactly. Code that replaces `adjustment_color_correction` or
  `tonemap_exposure` must re-apply brightness afterwards.
- `Player.apply_fov(deg)` sets the camera fov and CameraFX's `_base_fov` (the sprint kick adds on
  top) and moves the first-person `Hands` children and `HeldFirstPerson` so their x/y scale with
  `tan(fov/2)`. Anything new parented to the first-person camera should do the same (store its
  base position in meta `fov_base_pos`, or add it under `Hands`).
- `SettingsUI` (`scripts/settings_screen.gd`, a CanvasLayer at layer 6, child of Main):
  `open()`, `close()`, `is_open()`, `signal closed`. `Menu.chose_settings` opens it; while
  `game.paused` it shows its own "Settings" button under the HUD's PAUSED text. While open it
  eats keys and clicks except F2 / F3 / F11; Esc closes it (back to menu or pause).
  - The same pause-only stack also carries two exit buttons, `signal exit_to_menu_requested`
    and `signal exit_to_desktop_requested` (main.gd connects these; nothing else should need
    to). "Exit to Main Menu" reuses `Main._back_to_menu()` — the same teardown path Q/shove
    already uses to walk out mid-shift — so a host's exit is an ordinary `Net.leave()` (clients
    get the existing `Net.host_left` -> "The host left the game." handling) and a client's exit
    is an ordinary disconnect. "Exit to Desktop" is just `get_tree().quit()`. All three buttons
    hide together while the settings screen itself is open.
- Tests: `tools/settingstest.tscn` (headless), `tools/settingsshot.tscn` (windowed screenshots to
  `tools/settings_shots/`, plus the mouse-look sensitivity check that needs a captured mouse).

## Dev mode (dev worker, sweep 2 wave 1; redesigned 2026-09-16)

Secret tools for a normal session (`scripts/dev/**`). There is no dev level any more: a secret
pharmacy fax order (`game.DEV_CODE`, checked first in `game.order_pharmacy`: no money, no delivery)
calls `game.set_dev_tools(true, p)` on the host, which turns dev mode on for everyone in the session
(snapshot key `"dt"`) until DEV MODE OFF on the panel or the session ends. The fax UI prints a reply
page and waits on `dev.room_ready()` before it closes.

```gdscript
game.dev_tools: bool                     # every machine; replicated
game.dev_on() -> bool                    # what code checks
game.set_dev_tools(on, p := null)        # host; off also runs dev.reset_state()
```

- F1 (or the key left of 1) opens the dev panel anywhere while `dev_on()`. Local-only buttons: go to
  (you own your position), this machine's database (unlock every entry / reset) and tips.
- The hidden room (`dev_level.gd`): built on every machine by `dev.build_room()` when dev mode comes
  on (and again after a level rebuild), south of `level_info.neutral_rect` past the fog, snapped to
  tiles. `dev.room`, `dev.room_info` (world space: `arrive`, `monster_spawns`, `dummy_spots`,
  `containers`, `lights`, `dev_gate`, `nav_region`, `door_nodes`), `dev.in_room(pos)`. It holds the
  specimen pen and gate, one of every container, the item and loot dispensers, the gun rack and the
  dummy floor, and a separate navigation island (bots only use its dispensers from inside it). No
  tables, shelf, pharmacy or furnace: those are the hospital's.
- Every level with an `or_storage` room has `dev_door_closet` on the closet's west wall
  (`dev_door.gd`, "!Locked" unless dev mode is on); it and the room's `dev_door_exit` move the user
  (host `dev.walk_through`, a guest by the `dev_tp` event).
- Toggles default off in a normal session (`freeze_vitals`, `auto_revive`, `monsters_off`,
  `no_game_over`); `monsters_off` clears the monsters and stops `_spawn_monsters`, `no_game_over`
  keeps `all_players_out` from ending the run. A new shift's `_spawn_monsters` keeps the room's
  monsters.
- Requests new with the redesign: `dev_off`, `monsters_off {on}`, `no_game_over {on}`, `clock_in`,
  `clock_out` (forced), `skip_to_table` (`loop.dev_skip_to_table`: incoming patients onto free
  tables now), `abilities` (every ability at max level for the sender).

Game API (host only; wave 3 `downed` changes what these do, not their signatures):

```gdscript
game.dev: Node                           # scripts/dev/dev_room.gd, child "Dev" of Game, always present
game.damage_player(p, amount: int, source: String, knock := Vector3.ZERO)
    # every hurt goes here; monster_hit_player calls it. source: "monster:<kind>", "dev_gun:<name>"
game.knock_down_player(p, source: String, knock := Vector3.ZERO, seconds := 3.0)
    # downs the player at once (seconds is ignored); see "Downed players". The dev gun's secondary.
game.kill_player(p, source: String)      # dead until the next shift, downed or not; the dev gun's primary
game.kill_monster(m)                     # removes it for good; everyone sees it fall ("monster_killed" event)
game.knock_down_monster(m, dir := Vector3.ZERO, seconds := 4.0)   # Sonographer stunned, Night Nurse calmed
```

Player fields added: `is_bot` (a dev bot or target dummy: a real Player the host simulates
through the `bot_*` seam, remote on clients, not in `Net.names`, negative id), `stun` (seconds
knocked down, no movement; a `"stun"` event plus the dev snapshot block), `noclip`.

- Bots live in `game.players` like everyone else. Code that iterates players must not assume
  every id is in `Net.peer_ids()` (the HUD party list uses the roster, so bots are not listed).
  `_sync_players` never removes an `is_bot` player.
- Snapshot key `"dv"` carries the dev state (`dev.net_state()` / `dev.apply_net_state()`), empty
  without dev mode. Clients apply it before the player list so bot nodes exist.
- `game._event` passes kinds it does not know to `dev.on_event(kind, data)`.
- The panel's "Phone call" calls `game.dev_phone_call()`; "Extra patient" and "Skip grace" call
  `game.dev_extra_patient()` / `game.dev_skip_grace()` (requests `phone`, `extra_patient`,
  `skip_grace`). "Put on the table" uses the first free patient table and clocks in from a lobby.
- `surgery_system.gd` lets an `is_bot` operator operate on the host with the minigame's
  `bot_input(t, skill)` (skill from the bot's meta `bot_skill`). Minigames must keep
  `bot_input` finishing their step.
- Interactables: `dev_disp_<item kind>` dispensers (endless stacks) and `dev_disp_dev_gun`.
- Test tool: `--dev` after `--` turns dev mode on as soon as the level exists, so a review window
  (`tools
eview.bat 2 "..." --dev`) opens with the panel a keypress away.
- World changes from the panel or tests: `game.dev.request(action, args)`; the host applies,
  a client sends. Shots: `game.dev.fire(shooter, from, dir, "kill" | "knock")`.
- **Control Dr. Botsworth** (grafting chunk B, 2026-09-18): the panel's button spawns a bot called
  Dr. Botsworth if he is not there (an ordinary `is_bot` Player: real hands, a real operator at a
  table) and moves this machine's input and camera into him; the same button hands them back. Local
  only and host only, like the free camera -- nothing is replicated, so the rest of the session sees
  an ordinary bot, and your own surgeon stays where you left it, strapped down or not.
  `dev.control_botsworth()`, `dev.possess_bot(id)`, `dev.release_bot()`, `dev.possessing`,
  `dev.possessed_player()`; `Player.set_possessed(on)` / `possessed_local` / `view_local()`
  (`is_local or possessed_local`: first-person hands, the mouse, the aim highlight);
  `game.possessed`, `game.driving_player()` / `driving_id()` (what `viewed_player()`, the HUD and
  `surgery_system`'s local-operator and report routing use, so the minigames run under your mouse).
  The bot's brain is skipped while you drive it and picks its order back up afterwards.
- Sounds `dev_zap`, `dev_thump` from `tools/gen_audio_dev.mjs`.
- **Pocket spaces** (2026-09-14): request `pocket {kind: "factory" | "restaurant" | ""}` builds that space
  beside the room on every machine (`dv.pk`, `game.pockets.build_kind`); `dev.pocket_go(into)` moves the
  local player to its spawn and back (panel "Go there" / "Back to the start").
- **Night Nurse section** (2026-09-14): requests `nurse_ignore_watch {on}`, `nurse_walk {mode: "" |
  "follow" | "loop"}` (follow: the sender; loop: a 6 x 3.5 m rectangle round where the sender stands,
  long side along their facing, corners snapped to the navigation mesh) and `nurse_pace {i}`
  (`NURSE_PACES` 3.4 / 1.6 / 0.8 m/s); the panel's "Nurse in front" is `spawn_monster {night_nurse,
  front}`. Host fields `nurse_ignore_watch`, `nurse_walk`, `nurse_pace`, `nurse_who`, `nurse_loop`;
  the dv snapshot carries `nn: [ignore, walk, pace]`; `reset_state` clears them.
  `dev.nurse_settings() -> {ignore_watch, walk, who, loop, speed}` is what `Monster.dev_nurse()` hands
  the nurse brain (empty without dev mode). Ignoring: `observed` stays false (so the report's `ob`
  and every client's clip keep running) and she does not stalk; follow stops at 2.5 m and walk modes
  never lunge or hit. The pace replaces her 3.4 m/s in every walk, hunting included.

## Inventory and money (inventory worker, sweep 2 wave 2)

Hands (`scripts/player.gd`; all host side except the reads):

```gdscript
Player.empty_slot() / Player.empty_slots()      # static: {kind:"",count:0} / C.CARRY_CAP of them
p.slot_free(i) -> bool                          # no stack and not a bulky second half
p.head_of(i) -> int / p.tail_of(head) -> int    # the stack a slot belongs to / a bulky stack's 2nd slot (-1)
p.selected_head() -> int / p.selected_stack()   # what G, the shelf, the sell bin act on
p.slot_for(kind) -> int / p.can_take(kind)      # bulky needs two free slots (bulky_pair())
p.take_into(kind, count, value := 0) -> int     # merge or place (both halves for bulky); -1 without room
p.clear_slot(i)                                 # empties a stack and its second half (pass either)
p.free_slot_count() / p.hands_empty() / p.holding(kind) / p.select_step(dir)
p.hand_count(kind) -> int               # total across every hand slot (bulky's empty tail never matches)
p.consume_hand(kind, n) -> int          # host: removes up to n from hand slots, clears any it empties, returns how many
```

Anything that empties a slot must use `clear_slot` (or the host's `_fix_links()` tidies an orphaned
second half on the next tick). Code that spawns items out of hands must carry `s.v` into
`WorldItem.value`. Every hit, shove and knock-down still drops every stack through `_drop_hands`;
fragile loot of one cracks there instead (keeps `Game.LOOT_CRACK_KEEPS` of its value).

Items (`scripts/items.gd`): `Items.def(kind)` also answers loot kinds from
`scripts/economy/loot_table.gd` (kept out of `Items.ITEMS`, so the guide, the supply spawner and the
dev panel's supply lists do not list loot). New helpers: `is_loot`, `is_bulky`, `slots_needed`,
`stack_label(kind, count)`; `stacks()` now includes stackable loot.

Loot (`scripts/economy/`):

- `loot_table.gd`: `LOOT[kind]` `{name, short, value [min,max], tier 0..3, bulky, fragile, stack,
  batch, rooms {room_kind: weight, "*": any}, surfaces [...], containers {type: weight}, trinket}`, 11 kinds (plain: `pill_bottle`, `xray_film`,
  `heart_monitor`, `gold_watch`, `ultrasound`; trinkets, which sell and get a job in a later chunk:
  `desk_phone`, `laptop`, `defibrillator`, `reflex_hammer`, `epipen`, `pulse_oximeter`) plus the
  brains and eyes. Room keys are the real generated room kinds (`patient_room`, `supply_closet`,
  `janitor_closet`, `lab`, ...); trinkets are kept rarer than plain loot;
  `weight(kind, room_kind, depth)`, `roll_value(kind, depth, roll)` (+20% per depth).
- `loot_spawner.gd`: `plan(seed, shift, level_info, occupied) -> [{kind, count, value, container_id,
  slot, anchor, position?}]`, deterministic. A shift holds `LOOT_PER_SHIFT` (15 to 20) stacks,
  trinkets included (about $1,000 a shift); every non-bulky kind may also go in a container. Depth per location from the entry's `depth`, then a
  `level_info.rooms` or `level_info.wings` rect (tiles, or world metres when the rect is wider than
  the map in tiles, or `space: "world"`), else distance from the table. Safe rooms: `or`,
  `anteroom`, `clockin`, `break_room`, `entrance`, `lobby`, `neutral`, `outdoor`, `dev`.
- `game.spawn_loot()` (host) runs at clock-in (`game.clock_in()` and the `begin_shift()`
  shortcut), with the monsters; supplies come later, with each accepted patient.

Colour coding (`scripts/item_models.gd`): `ItemModels.make_tinted(kind, count, soft := false)`,
`apply_tint(node, kind, soft)`, `tint_material(kind, soft) -> Material` (teal for surgical, gold for
loot, null otherwise; one cached shader, applied as `material_overlay` on a model's 5 biggest
meshes). Use it for anything that shows an item in the world, in hands or on a shelf; minigames
keep the plain `make()`. `soft` is the fainter rim for first-person held stacks.

Money (host authoritative, replicated as `g.mn`, survives `start_lobby`):

```gdscript
game.money: int                               # team money
game.add_money(amount: int, reason: String)   # host; clamps at 0 unless reason starts with "debt:"
game.reset_money()                            # host; money to 0 (game over; start_session calls it)
game.economy                                  # scripts/economy/economy.gd, child "Economy"
game.economy.pharmacy / .furnace              # nodes once placed (placed() true); positions helpers
game.economy.money_visible_for(p) -> bool     # HUD: near the pharmacy/furnace, aiming at the
                                              # lobby fax terminal, the order form open, or just changed
game.economy.request_order({kind: sets})      # this machine's player orders (host direct, client RPC)
game.economy.open_fax_ui() / .fax_ui          # the order form (scripts/economy/fax_order_ui.gd)
```

### The pharmacy and the crematorium furnace (pharmacy worker, sweep 4A chunk 3; HUB REDESIGN, 2026-09-15)

Gold bars, the sell bin and the shop van are gone. Buying is a fax order from the lobby's fax terminal
(an interactable, `scripts/economy/fax_terminal.gd`, hub rebuild chunk 3); selling is throwing into the crematorium
furnace (a thrown-item Area3D, `scripts/economy/furnace.gd`). **HUB REDESIGN**: both are now real
walled rooms off the lobby, each with its own single door (`scripts/level/entrance.gd`), not just
open floor. Placement, first match: `level_info.safe_zone {pharmacy_rect, crematorium_rect}` (the
lobby rects `entrance.gd`'s `spots["reserve"]` fixed, chunk 2, now sized to those rooms'
interiors), `level_info.economy {shop, furnace}` (hand-placed; the dev room), else a deterministic
search for free floor around the time clock (`economy.gd`'s `_search_spots`). Placement runs two
physics frames after `_add_landmarks`.

```gdscript
game.order_pharmacy(p, {kind: sets}) -> bool   # host; also takes an Array of kinds (one set each). Takes
                                    # price x sets, queues the order, broadcasts "pharmacy_order"
game.buy_pills(p) -> bool           # host; one set of pills, order_pharmacy(p, ["placebo_pills"])
game.PHARMACY_CATALOG               # [{kind, name, count, price}] per set; PHARMACY_MAX_QTY sets a line
game.eat_pill(p)                    # host; take one from the held bottle, same hit reaction as a throw
game.furnace_sell(kind, count, value, at)   # host; the furnace calls this once a sale resolves
game.furnace_can_sell(kind) -> bool  # loot (incl. brains) and placebo_pills; nothing else
game.furnace_value(kind, slot) -> int  # brains: spoiled value; placebo_pills: 0; else slot.v
game.PILL_PRICE / game.PILL_COUNT    # $15, 10 pills a bottle
game.ROCKET_BOOTS_PRICE              # $100 a pair (catalog line "rocket_boots", count 1)
game.player_faceplanted(p)           # host; a rocket dive hit a wall head on: damage_player(p, 1, "faceplant")
```

- **Rocket boots** (`Items.is_worn(kind)`, def key `wear`): the one worn item. Taking a pair
  (`game.pickup_item`, `game.give_hand`, the dev dispenser) calls `player.put_on_boots()` instead of
  filling a hand, prompt "Put on Rocket boots", refused ("!Already wearing rocket boots") while
  `player.boots`. A stack of several loses one pair per taker. `boots` is host authoritative
  (report_full `"bt"`), survives death and respawn, and `game.reset_money()` (a new run) clears it.
  The furnace doesn't take them (not sellable: they bounce back out).
- **The rocket dive** (player.gd "ROCKET BOOTS", client-owned movement like the dive): crouch still
  held `ROCKET_IGNITE_HOLD` after a sprint-dive fires lights the boots once per dive (a tap stays a
  plain dive). While lit (`rocketing`, report bit 256 / report_full `"rk"`, `rocket_burning()`): flat
  `ROCKET_SPEED` along the dive's locked heading, vertical speed eased to 0 (level flight), the
  capsule at prone height until the dive ends, eye `ROCKET_EYE_H`, `fuel` (0..1, local like stamina)
  drains over `FUEL_BURN_TIME`. It ends on letting go, running dry, going down or losing control;
  the dive then falls and lands as usual. Fuel refills over `FUEL_REFILL_TIME` on the ground, not
  diving. A slide collision after the move with a near-horizontal normal against the heading
  (`FACEPLANT_DOT`) is a faceplant: burn over, bounced back, heading cleared (it just falls), and
  `faceplant_count` (report_state index 16) bumps; the host's `_consume_actions` calls
  `game.player_faceplanted` (skipped while invulnerable or in god mode). The look is
  `scripts/rocket_boots.gd` (heel pods on `foot.L`/`foot.R`, top-level flames and a glow trailing
  the travel direction, cue `rocket_burn`); HUD element `"fuel"` under stamina while wearing a pair
  and it isn't full. Test: `tools/controlstest.tscn` ("rocket boots").

- **The pharmacy** (`scripts/economy/economy_props.gd`, hub rebuild chunk 3): a wall of steel bars
  across the pharmacy (width 13.5 m in the hub, 3 m in the dev room) with a pickup drawer through a
  slot in them, a receiving fax machine behind the bars, and the Night Nurse's model as the
  attendant -- set dressing, no Monster node, no brain, never a threat. Ordering is E on the lobby
  **fax terminal** in front of the bars (interact_id `"pharmacy_fax"`; `interact` is a no-op, main.gd
  opens the form on this machine): a fax page with a tick box per `PHARMACY_CATALOG` entry and a
  quantity (1..`PHARMACY_MAX_QTY` sets: - / +, typed, or the mouse wheel; shift steps 10), the total
  and the team's money. SEND FAX feeds the page into the machine, then `economy.request_order`.
  The host takes the money at once; `economy.pharmacy.queue_order(items)` (every machine, via the
  `"pharmacy_order"` broadcast) runs the timeline: the page prints, the nurse fetches and reads it
  (page in her raised hand), goes behind the shelves, brings the order and the drawer slides out
  toward the lobby; the host spawns one `WorldItem` stack per line (count = sets x per-set count)
  on the tray once it is fully out. It closes once nothing is left on it. `tools/faxcheck.tscn`
  runs it headless.
- **The waiting-room Night Nurse** (`scripts/economy/waiting_nurse.gd`, hub rebuild chunk 3):
  scenery on `level_info.waiting_seats`; host-driven, replicated as `g.wn`. Unwatched she sometimes
  gets up and changes seats or stands in a `waiting_corners` spot; watched (`Percept.observed_any`)
  she freezes mid-move. She never goes for players.
- **The furnace**: a grate of vertical steel bars across the mouth blocks players, monsters and
  carried bodies like any `C.L_WORLD` wall (a real collider, not a special case), while a thrown
  item small enough to clear a gap reaches `FireZone`, an `Area3D` monitoring `C.L_PICKUP` only.
  `furnace._on_body_entered` resolves the sale host-side: sellable stacks are consumed and
  `furnace_sell` pays out (a flame-card burst + `economy_sell` + the amount floating up);
  unsellable stacks (surgical tools, the guide) get `toss()`ed back out instead of freed. A miss
  (hits a bar, or nothing) just settles on the floor as an ordinary drop. **HUB REDESIGN**: the
  brick wings and back wall are built wide and floor-to-ceiling now, so the furnace reads as built
  into the crematorium room's back wall (a hole with fire behind it) instead of a furnace-shaped
  box standing in a generic room; the grate/FireZone/selling logic above is unchanged.
- **Charged throw** (`scripts/player.gd`, `game.drop_selected(p, charge)`): holding Drop charges
  0..1 over `Player.DROP_CHARGE_FULL` seconds (client-owned, replicated as the 15th element of
  `report_state()`); releasing fires `toss()` at a charge-scaled velocity (`Game.THROW_MIN/MAX_SPEED`,
  `_UP`). A tap (`charge <= Player.DROP_TAP_MAX`) is the old gentle set-down. A charged throw of a
  `placebo_pills` stack fires exactly one pill (`WorldItem` meta `pill_thrown`/`pill_thrower`/
  `pill_spawn_t`) and leaves the rest of the bottle in hand.
- **Placebo pills** (3e): `Items.ITEMS.placebo_pills`, a consumable not in `found` (never spawns in
  the wings), stacks like any consumable (count = pills, not bottles). `game.pill_check_hit(it)`
  (host, called every physics frame a thrown pill is airborne, `world_item.gd`) checks players (not
  downed), `patient_tables`/`case_on_table`, then `monsters`, in that order, radius
  `Game.PILL_HIT_RADIUS`. A hit is resolved and replicated over `_event`:
  - a **player** (self or a teammate): `_event "pill_player"` to that peer only -- the personal
    line (`PillLines.pick(peer_id)`, `scripts/economy/pill_lines.gd`, the exact 50-line list, never
    repeated back to back for that player) and `Player.add_warm()` (local-only fade in ~2 s / hold
    ~15 s / fade out ~3 s, stacks up to `Player.WARM_CAP`, drawn by `hud.gd`).
  - a **patient/monster**: `_event "pill_line"` to everyone -- a floating quoted line
    (`game._spawn_pill_line`, a local `Label3D`, decorative, not replicated state). An OR-table
    patient also gets `game.pill_notes[table] = world_time`, replicated in `g.pn`, read by
    `OrScreenModel._pill_note()` for a green "Patient appears comforted" blip
    (`or_screen_canvas.gd`'s `_pill_note`) for `OrScreenModel.PILL_NOTE_SECONDS`; vitals/sedation
    never change.
  - a **miss**: the pill settles as an ordinary floor pickup, same as any dropped item.
  - Chunk 4 adds the database entry for placebo pills (`docs/SWEEP4A.md` 3e).

Dev room: `dev_disp_<loot kind>` cubbies (a rack on the south wall, `DispenserScript.create(kind,
true)`), `game.dev.request("money", {amount})` / `{reset: true}` (panel "Money" section), and
`level_info.economy {shop, furnace}` spots. Tests: `tools/inventorytest.tscn` (headless, including
the pharmacy/furnace/pill checks), `tools/inventoryshot.tscn` (windowed shots to
`tools/inventory_shots/`), nettest scenario `economy`, devtest inventory checks, perfprobe
`crematorium, fire up close` and `--ab` rows `no item rims` / `loot hidden`.

## Shift loop and patients (loop worker, sweep 2 wave 2)

Cases (`scripts/game.gd`, host authoritative, replicated):

```gdscript
game.cases: Array          # each: {id, table (index into level_info.tables, -1 on the gurney),
                           #  patient_id ("bob"|"seal"|"player"), player_id (player cases), ailment_id,
                           #  step_index, flags, vitals, state ("incoming"|"on_table"|"stable"|"dead"),
                           #  optional (true for the extra patient)}
game.case_on_table(table_index) -> Dictionary   # any state but incoming; {} when free; the live dictionary
game.case_by_id(id) -> Dictionary
game.add_case(c) -> int         # host; defaults step 0, flags {}, vitals 100, state on_table with a table
                                # else incoming; -1 if that table holds a live case (a finished one is replaced)
game.finish_case(id, won)       # host; stable (stays on its table) or dead (flatlines, vitals 0)
game.remove_case(id)            # host
signal cases_changed            # every machine: added, removed, onto a table, step, state (not vitals)
game.case / game.vitals / game.patient_body   # aliases of the first non-player case
game.patient_tables: [{index, position, yaw}] # the kind "patient" tables
game.surgeries                  # one surgery system per patient table, same order
game.surgery                    # the one the local player operates at (or is blending back from), else the first case's
game.surgery_for_table(i) / body_for_table(i) / table_position(i) / table_yaw_of(i)
game.table_interact_id(i)       # "table" for the first patient table, "table_<index>" for the others
game.free_patient_table() -> int   # no case and no paramedics heading there, or -1
game.end_operations(p)          # host: p steps back from every table
game.spawn_supplies_for(c)      # host: the first case gets ItemSpawner.plan; later ones a shortfall top-up
```

- Vitals drain only while `on_table`. Player cases (`patient_id "player"`) get no PatientBody, no
  surgery system, no drain and no pay from this code: the `downed` worker owns them.
- Levels without `level_info.tables` (the dev room, the fallback ward, old tile maps) get the
  level's `table` plus a second table built beside it (`scripts/loop/tables.gd`, deterministic);
  `level_info.tables` is then filled with both and `tables_fallback` set.

The loop (`scripts/loop/shift_loop.gd`, `game.loop`, child "Loop"):

```gdscript
game.clock_in()                 # host: LOBBY -> SHIFT: loot, monsters, first call rings right away (the clock's hold calls it)
game.begin_shift()              # host, tools: clock in and put the first patient straight on a table
game.finish_shift(text, secs)   # host: the paycheck screen (Phase.WON), then the next shift's lobby
game.game_over(text)            # host: Phase.LOST, then game.reset_money() and a new run (new seed, shift 1)
game._end_shift(won, text)      # tests: won = forced clock-out, else game over
game.dev_phone_call() / dev_extra_patient() / dev_skip_grace()
game.monster_may_wander_to(p) -> bool   # false inside the entrance building or the neutral area (zone_of)
loop.grace_left, call_kind ("first"|"extra"), call_state ("ringing"|"talking"), subtitle, first_called,
  crews {case id: {p, y, ph "in"|"hand"|"out", pt, ai, tb}}, pay_note     # replicated as g "lp.*"
loop.start_call(kind) / answer(p) / clock_out(force) / can_clock_out() / skip_grace()
loop.objective_text() / missing_supplies() / clock_prompt(p) / phone_prompt()
loop.force_first / force_extra = {patient_id, ailment_id}   # tests pin what the calls bring
loop.pay_for(case, shift) -> int   # stable 200 (+25/shift), extra stable 300 (+40/shift), dead -150
```

- Players start a run at `level_info.neutral.spawn_points` (else `player_spawns`): `game.spawn_points()`.
- Clock in and the phone rings immediately (`GRACE_SECONDS` is 0, kept only as a named constant for
  tests/tools). E on interactable `phone` answers (subtitles
  for everyone); after `AUTO_ANSWER_SECONDS` (8) the answering machine takes it. Taking the call
  adds the case (`incoming`) and spawns its supplies; `DISPATCH_DELAY` (3 s) later a crew leaves
  `level_info.ambulance` (else `entrance`, else the spawn farthest from the table), walks the
  navmesh to a free patient table, hands over (state `on_table`) and walks back.
- 45 to 150 s after the first patient is on a table the phone rings with the optional extra patient
  (a different patient); answering accepts, `EXTRA_DECLINE_SECONDS` (20) of ringing declines.
- The clock allows clocking out once the first call was taken and no case is incoming or on a
  table (a ringing extra call is declined by clocking out). Pay goes through `game.add_money`
  (a dead patient's penalty clamps at $0). Monsters are removed at clock-out.
- **Next shift: same entrance, new wings** (doors sweep). The seed stays for the whole run; `shift`
  goes up. The next lobby rebuilds the wings behind the locked gates (`game.wing_loader`, see "Doors
  and the per-shift wings"); anyone still in a wing is walked out to the entrance hall and what was
  left lying in the wings goes with them. At clock-in (which waits for the wings) loot, monsters
  and (per case) supplies spawn fresh, and the gates unlock. Hands are kept at the next lobby; the
  dead and late joiners get up at the start. Game over builds a new hospital (`seed + 7919`).
  Clients learn the phase from `_rpc_shift`/snapshots and move themselves.
- Game over: during a shift, `game.all_players_out()` (downed worker: every non-waiting player is
  downed or dead). Never in the dev room. At the next shift's lobby the dead and the downed get
  up at the start.
- The player table (downed worker): the stitches operation stays in
  `scripts/downed/player_surgery.gd`; the host mirrors it into `game.cases` every tick as a
  `patient_id "player"` case with `mirror: true`, `table = game.player_table_index()` (hub rebuild
  chunk 2: whichever free OR table the carrier put them on, `game.set_downed_table(index)`; on
  fallback levels the "player" entry of `level_info.tables`, appended once that table is placed),
  `player_id`, `ailment_id "stitches"`, `step_index`, `flags`, `vitals` (the bleed clock) and state
  `on_table` (`stable` once the step is done). It gets no PatientBody, drain, pay or clock-out
  rule from the loop; it exists so it replicates with the cases and the OR monitor lists it.
- The phone: on a level with `level_info.phone` at wall height the loop adds the aim target, a
  blinking lamp and a glow to the hospital's wall phone; otherwise it builds a desk phone on a side
  table near the clock. Sounds `loop_ring`, `loop_pickup`, `loop_hangup`, `loop_gurney`,
  `loop_siren`, `loop_clockout` (`tools/gen_audio_loop.mjs`).
- Tests: `tools/looptest.tscn` (headless, the whole loop), `tools/playtest.tscn` (the loop,
  `--extra`, `--skip-grace`), `tools/loopshot.tscn` (windowed shots to `tools/loop_shots/`),
  devtest's loop hooks, nettest `deliver`, `surgery`, `late_join`, `full_shift_lag`, `economy`
  (loot kept through a shift) and `two_patients`.

### The fog lot and the driven ambulance (fog lot worker, sweep 4A chunk 2, 2026-09-15)

The lot outside the main doors is now empty asphalt (`scripts/level/neutral.gd`) ringed by thick
fog past `FogRing.inner_rect(level_info)` (`scripts/level/fog_ring.gd`; `neutral_rect` shrunk by
`FogRing.MARGIN_M` on every side but the one against the entrance building). Everything is a pure
function of that rect, computed identically on every machine with no extra network traffic:

```gdscript
FogRing.on_lot(pos, level_info) -> bool
FogRing.depth_m(pos, level_info) -> float          # 0 inside the clear area or off the lot entirely
FogRing.visibility01(depth) -> float               # 0 clear .. 1 fully blind/deaf
FogRing.steer_yaw(pos, yaw, level_info, delta) -> float   # bends back with depth, snaps to face the
                                                    # lot once fully blind past FogRing.SNAP_M
FogRing.pull_from_fog(pos, level_info) -> Vector3  # where a settled item in the fog belongs instead
FogRing.apply_camera_fog(cam, depth01, cache)      # the local screen-space fog look (per camera)
```

That per-camera tint alone only shows up once a player's own position is inside the belt, so the
lot also gets one real `FogVolume` (`HospitalBuilder._build_fog_belt()`, world-space, sized off
the same `neutral_rect` / `MARGIN_M`), so the fog reads as atmosphere from anywhere on the lot
(including standing at the doors) instead of only from inside it. It only renders when
`Environment.volumetric_fog_enabled` is on (off at the LOW quality preset, see `look.gd`).

`player.gd`'s `_local_step` calls `steer_yaw` for whichever player it is actually driving (client-
owned movement, same rule as everything else there -- a carried player needs nothing extra since
their body just follows the carrier, who is doing the steering) and, for the local player only,
feeds `visibility01` to `CameraFX.set_fog()` (a per-camera Environment override, cloned from
whatever the camera already had, so brightness/tonemap keep working) and to
`Audio.set_fog_muffle()` (a low-pass on the SFX/Ambience buses). `world_item.gd`'s settle step
calls `pull_from_fog` once an item comes to rest, so a drop or a throw that lands in the fog
comes back out at the clear area's edge. None of this touches the tuned global volumetric fog
(`scripts/look.gd`).

The ambulance is a driven, host-authoritative vehicle, replicated the same way the paramedic
crews are (inside `loop.net_state()` / `apply_net_state()`, field `"am"`):

```gdscript
loop.ambulance: Dictionary   # {ph: "hidden"|"out"|"parked"|"back", p: Vector3, y: float, honk: bool}
                             # empty until the first tick on a level with level_info.ambulance
```

`_ambulance_active()` is true while a delivery is incoming or a crew is still walking the patient
in (`ph` "in"/"hand"); the ambulance drives from `ambulance.lane_start` to `ambulance.position`
(the bay) while active and back once it isn't -- a fresh dispatch while it is still out or parked
just keeps it there, one after it already left starts a new trip from "hidden". A standing,
non-carried player within `AMBULANCE_LANE_RADIUS` of its remaining path stops it and sets `honk`
(local presentation plays `amb_honk`, `tools/gen_audio_ambulance.mjs`); it never hurts anyone.
`scripts/loop/ambulance.gd` is the local-only visual node (one per machine, synced like the crew
nodes): the existing "ambulance" piece mesh, headlights and a flasher that glow through the fog
(`light_volumetric_fog_energy`), no new model.

- Tests: `tools/fogtest.tscn` (headless: a walker deep in the fog steers back out without
  reaching the border wall, a dropped item settles back onto the clear lot, the ambulance leaves
  the fog for a delivery, parks, unloads, stops and honks for a player in its lane, and drives
  back once the delivery is done), `tools/perfprobe.tscn` scenario "lot, facing the fog".

## Models (loot and paramedic models, sweep 2 integration)

`scripts/assets.gd` entries may now carry `pitch` / `roll` (degrees, applied before `yaw`),
`size` (longest side in metres) or `height` (metres) — either makes `spawn()` measure the model
once and put its base on the floor, centred — plus `hide` (mesh node names to skip) and `albedo`
(a replacement colour texture). New helpers: `Assets.fixup(key) -> Transform3D` (what `spawn()`
applies) and `Assets.measure(key, xf) -> AABB`. Keys: `item/<loot kind>` for the kinds with a model,
`crew/paramedic_a`, `crew/paramedic_b`, `mat/xray_film`. Assets starts
threaded loads of every `item/*` and `crew/*` file in `_ready`.

`scripts/item_models.gd`:

```gdscript
ItemModels.asset_mesh(kind) -> ArrayMesh      # the kind's shared real-model mesh, or null (primitive)
ItemModels.asset_transform(kind) -> Transform3D   # what that mesh is drawn with (identity when merged)
ItemModels.merge_parts(parts, tri_budget) -> ArrayMesh  # [[Mesh, surface, Transform3D, Material]]:
                                              # one surface per material, decimated, compacted, LODs
ItemModels.primitives_only                    # static, tools only: build everything from primitives
```

`make()` / `make_tinted()` / `footprint()` keep their contracts; `footprint()` of a non-stacking
kind with a model is the model's measured size. A model stack is one `MeshInstance3D` per copy
sharing the mesh (the rim goes on it). `LootModels.asset_extras(kind) -> {copies, parts, recolour}`
adds details to a kind's merged model (economy visuals).

`scripts/loop/crew.gd` (HUMAN HOOK, 2026-09-14): the medics are the Blender paramedics
`crew/human_paramedic_a` (front, `Walk` at speed / 1.40, `Idle` when stopped) and `crew/human_paramedic_b`
(back, 1.49 m behind the centre with both hands on the handle, `Push` at speed / 1.25, frozen when
stopped); before that the medics were `crew/paramedic_*` models (still the fallback) animated by an `AnimationTree`
(idle/walk blend by speed, the back medic's arms from "holding-both"), with the capsule figures as
the fallback; the crew has an `AnimatableBody3D` "Blocker" on `C.L_WORLD` (mask 0) that anything
building a look-alike crew must remove (the warmup does). `CrewScript.shapes_only` (static, tools
only) forces the capsule medics. The fallback levels' desk phone (`phone.gd` `create(false)`) uses
the `desk_phone` loot model when it exists.

## OR screen and minimal HUD (orscreen worker, sweep 2 wave 3)

The OR wall monitor (`scripts/orscreen/`) is derived locally on every machine from state that is
already replicated (`game.cases` or `game.case` / `game.vitals`, `game.shelf`, the surgery
operator); it adds nothing to the snapshot.

```gdscript
game.or_screen                          # scripts/orscreen/or_screen.gd, child "ORScreen" of Game
game.or_screen.mounted() -> bool        # a monitor exists in the current level
game.or_screen.placement                # "level_info" | "wall" | "floating"
game.or_screen.screen_centre() / screen_normal()   # world; the glass faces screen_normal()
game.or_screen.model                    # the last model drawn (see below)
game.or_screen.refresh_now()            # rebuild and redraw at once
game.or_screen.set_enabled(on)          # hide it and stop refreshing (perf A/B)
game.or_screen.model_override = {...}   # test seam: draw this model instead of the game's
OrScreenModel.build(game) -> Dictionary # scripts/orscreen/or_screen_model.gd, pure
```

- Placement: every new `game.level` gets its monitors two physics frames later: one per table from
  `level_info.or_screens` (hub rebuild chunk 2; each shows only its table's panel), else one at
  `level_info.or_screen` (centre of the glass on the wall, `yaw` facing -Z into the room, as the
  hospital builds it; the glass is laid onto the hospital's own `or_screen_mount` piece), else on
  the flattest wall facing the tables found by ray casts (the dev room), else floating near the
  table.
- Model: `{mode: "idle" | "cases", phase, shift, lobby, panels: [{id, table, patient_id,
  patient_name, ailment_id, ailment_name, code, state, vitals, level: "ok" | "low" | "critical",
  steps: [{label, item, item_name, state: "done" | "current" | "todo"}], current, supplies:
  [{kind, name, need, have, ok}], ready, operator, progress}]}`. Supplies are
  `Procedures.remaining_requirements` against the shared shelf, handed out to cases in order
  (tools are not used up). Cases come from `game.cases` (the `loop` contract in `docs/SWEEP2.md`)
  when that exists, else the legacy single case; player cases show the Player's name. The operator
  comes from `game.surgery_for_table(table)` when the game has it, else `game.surgery` for the
  first case.
- Cost: the SubViewport renders only on request, at 12 Hz within 7 m and 5 Hz beyond, and never
  while the glass is out of the live camera's view or past 22 m. Its OmniLight (`Glow`, energy
  0.16, green / amber / red from the worst case) re-tints at 4 Hz. Registered in `Warmup`.
- HUD (`scripts/hud.gd`): only the icon item bar, crosshair + interact prompt + hold progress, the
  player's hearts (+ stamina while not full), messages and the dead banner, the money readout, the
  first-seconds controls line, the lobby host address and the pause / end overlays. `hud.drawn`
  lists the element ids the last frame drew. Anything new about the case, the steps or supplies
  belongs on the monitor, not the HUD.
- The icon item bar (2026-09-18, docs/ITEMS_AND_ICONS.md chunk C; `scripts/hud.gd` `_draw_hands`, icons
  from `scripts/item_icons.gd`): four square slots (one per hand slot, `C.CARRY_CAP`) bottom centre,
  each the kind's bare icon on a dark rounded square with its category border, the key number in a
  corner and a live `xN` badge on stacks; no prices. The selected slot is lifted and outlined; a bulky
  stack whose two slots touch is ONE wide slot (a pair that wraps round the bar stays two squares with a
  bracket). The layout is pure: `Hud.bar_units(w, h, slots, selected_head, alt_t)` returns
  `[{slot, rect, wide, ghost, sel, keys, other}]` (tools/hudtest.gd reads it); `hud.slots_drawn` lists
  "slot" / "wide" per unit drawn. The held item's name shows above the bar for 2 s when what you hold
  changes (`item_name` in `hud.drawn`). Pickup pop: a new item or a bigger count in a slot flies its icon
  from the crosshair into that slot in 0.3 s (`pickup_pop`). Alt shrinks the row to small squares and the
  ability bar grows into the bar as before (the ability circles now sit just under that small row).
  Body parts spoil visibly: a ring drains round the slot and the icon greys (a spoiled part stays grey).
  Eyes read `game.vats.eye_factor`, brains `game.brains.factor_of`, any other kind the numbers in its
  stack: `fresh` (0..1) and `spoiled` (bool). A used-up trinket is a stack with `used: true`: greyed with
  a crack (nothing sets it yet; the trinkets chunk does). A kind with no icon draws a plain slot with its
  first letters in its category colour.
- `ItemIcons` (`scripts/item_icons.gd`): `bare(kind)` / `framed(kind)` / `grey(kind)` /
  `ability(id)` -> Texture2D or null, `border(kind)`, `category(kind)`, `is_trinket(kind)`,
  `kind_named(display_name)`. `ALIAS` maps kinds whose art is filed under another name (`eye_hive` ->
  `hive_eyeball`). Icons are imported with mipmaps, so draw them on a CanvasItem with
  `texture_filter = TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS` (the HUD, the OR monitor canvas and the
  database do). `Warmup` calls `ItemIcons.preload_all()`.
- Icons elsewhere: the ability bar draws `art/icons/hive_eyes.svg` / `echolocation.svg` in its round
  slots with a glow in the ability's colour (steady ready, stronger in use, dim on cooldown; the radial
  sweep stays; an ability with no icon keeps its glyph). The database's item and procedure pages show
  the framed icon(s) beside the turntable and the item grids put it on each card. The OR monitor shows
  the item a step needs (and each supply row) as its framed icon, and the table's "Hold X to do this."
  prompt shows X's icon beside it.
- Surgery HUD (`scripts/surgery/surgery_hud.gd`): the operator sees one slim strip, step n/N and
  title, the patient's vitals as a number (`case.vitals` of the system's own case when it has
  one), the one-line hint and "Esc / E: step away". Gauges and the progress bar are gone;
  `cross_section` is still drawn above the strip when a minigame returns it. Spectators keep the
  small "X is operating" line.
- Work lamp: `SurgerySystem.make_work_lamp()` and the `LAMP_*` constants in
  `scripts/surgery/surgery_system.gd` (energy 0.5); the minigame lab uses the same function.
- Tests: `tools/orscreentest.tscn` (headless shift + synthetic cases),
  `tools/gameshot.tscn -- --only=orscreen [--tag=1600]` (shots 11-20),
  `tools/perfprobe.tscn -- --orscreen` (OR view and close-up with the monitor on and off) and the
  perfprobe `--ab` row `no OR screen`.

## Downed players (downed worker, sweep 2 wave 3)

0 HP downs a player; nothing a hit does kills. The Re-Gen Pod is gone (no `pod`, `pod_pos()`,
`C.POD_SECONDS`, `level_info.pod` or `regen_pod` piece). All host authoritative; the Player fields
ride in `report_full` (`dn bl cb ca ot ch`).

```gdscript
# Player (scripts/player.gd)
p.downed: bool            # alive but not standing: lies down, crawls (CRAWL_SPEED), no sprint, E only calls for help
p.bleed: float            # seconds left; every machine runs it (game.bleed_rate), the host's is the truth
p.carried_by: int         # carrier's peer id, 0 = nobody; the body is pinned to game.pinned_pose(p)
p.carrying: int           # carried player's peer id; carrier moves at CARRY_SPEED_K, cannot shove, drop or use things
p.on_table: bool          # lying on the player table, pinned there, looking up
p.carry_hold: float       # seconds this player has held E on a downed teammate (HUD "LIFTING")
p.held_by: int            # held up by the Night Nurse (her monster id, -1 nobody; "nh"), see "The Night Nurse's grab"
p.downed_aim              # Area3D "DownedAim", interact_id "pl_<peer id>", on C.L_INTERACT only while lying free
p.refresh_downed_visuals() / p.look_up_from_table()

game.downed_view           # scripts/downed/downed_view.gd: blood trails, the local vignette and bleed clock
```

- Damage: `damage_player` ends operations, drops hands, drops whoever the victim carries, and at 0 HP
  calls `down_player`. Shoving a carrier drops the carried player. Monsters never hit a downed player.
- Carrying: aim at a downed teammate (`pl_<id>`) with empty hands and hold E for `CARRY_HOLD`
  (simulated by the host from `wants_interact` + `aim_id`). E again puts them down in front (a
  reliable `placed` event tells the downed machine where, since it owns its position); E aimed at
  the `player_table` proxy lays them on it. The carried body rides the LEFT shoulder (`pinned_pose` -0.55 x); the carried
  player's camera hangs a metre behind that point.
- Player table: `level_info.tables` entry with `kind == "player"` (the hospital's), else a clear spot
  2.7-3.4 m from the OR table; a table model (`scripts/downed/player_table.gd`) is built only when
  nothing is under the spot. Aim proxy `player_table` (prompt "Place X on the table", or the stitches
  operation's prompt).
- **Human model (2026-09-14, HUMAN HOOK)**: `player_body.gd` builds the player's surgeon variation
  (`HumanModel.surgeon_for(player_id)`, scrubs tinted by the colour) lying in its `Lying` clip, with
  `Human_TopLower` hidden and `Human_TopRolled` shown; `gash` is the model's `Site_gash` (on `spine`),
  levelled; `site_section("gash").half_len` 0.096 x height / 1.78. New `set_gash_open(f)` (1 fresh .. 0
  closed) drives the `GashOpen` blend shape of `Human_GashSkin` and the skin shader's `gash`; the
  stitches step calls it with `open_fraction()` every frame, `stitched` closes it. The primitive body
  is the fallback (`PlayerBody.primitive_only` forces it).
- Stitches: `Procedures.AILMENTS.stitches`, one step `{id: "stitch", item: "suture_kit", uses: 1,
  game: "stitches", site: "gash"}`, needing a kit on the shared shelf. The case
  `{patient_id: "player", player_id, ailment_id: "stitches", step_index, flags}` and the operation's
  net state ride in the global snapshot field `pt`. Its vitals are the patient's bleed clock
  (100 = five minutes); a botch costs `BOTCH_BLEED_SECONDS` (4) per point. The finished step revives
  the patient 1.2 s later. Replace with `game.add_case` in the integration wave.
- Player body (`scripts/downed/player_body.gd`, `create(peer_id, colour)`): lying along X, head toward
  -X, origin at the table top; site `gash`; `site_transform`, `has_site`, `site_section("gash") ->
  {half_len, half_gap}`, `set_bleeding`, `stir`, `set_vitals`, `apply_flags` (`stitched` shows the
  scar), `show_gash(on)` (the minigame hides the painted gash while it draws its own), plus
  `infection_start` (INF) and `make_severed_limb` (null) for the patient-body surface.
- Stitches minigame (`scripts/surgery/games/stitches.gd`): six stitches, each a click on the green ring
  outside one edge then on the ring across; amber = loose (closes less, oozes), red = torn skin
  (1.5) or a stab into the open wound (2.5). Net state `s h fq q c pu b bt be st p`. Self-test
  `--selftest=stitches`; the lab runs it on a player body with `--game=stitches`.
- Dev room: `game.dev.request("down_me", {id?})` (the panel's "Down me" and each bot row's "Down"),
  a carry order with `to: "table"` ("downed to table") lifts the nearest downed player and lays them
  on the player table, and the operate order stitches up whoever lies there first (stocking a kit).
  `dev_level` adds a player table south of the OR table.
- Sounds `downed_fall`, `downed_call`, `downed_lift`, `downed_stitch`, `downed_tug`
  (`tools/gen_audio_downed.mjs`).
- Tests: `tools/downedtest.tscn` (headless), `tools/downedshot.tscn` (windowed shots into
  `tools/downed_shots/`), nettest scenario `downed`, devtest downed checks.

### Strapping yourself down (grafting chunk B, 2026-09-18, docs/GRAFTING.md)

A healthy surgeon can lie on the table themselves, awake, and hold E to get up. The state is the
same `on_table` as a downed patient's, with no case and no stitches, so everything that already
follows `on_table` (the pinned pose, the look-up camera, the "lying" clip, `ot` in the snapshot)
works unchanged. `Player.strapped()` is the difference: `on_table and alive and not downed`.

```gdscript
game.TABLE_STRAP_HOLD (1.2 s)  game.TABLE_UP_HOLD (1.2 s)  game.STRAP_IN_PROMPT
game.strap_in_prompt(q) -> String        # STRAP_IN_PROMPT, "!..." or "" (not on offer)
game.strap_in(q, table_index := -1)      # host; the hold finished (never a tap)
game.get_up_block(p) -> String           # "" = free to go. CHUNK C REFUSES HERE after the scoop
game.get_up_prompt(p) -> String          # what the strapped surgeon sees looking up
game.get_up_from_table(p)                # host; the straps come off, they stand beside the table
game.someone_on_table() -> Node          # whoever lies on a table (downed or strapped), else null
game.table_free(ti) -> bool              # no case, no gurney on the way, nobody lying on it
game.strap_table: int                    # hub: the patient table they strapped to (-1); snapshot "st"
```

- The prompt hangs off the existing aim spots: `player_table` on levels with one, and each patient
  table (`table`, `table_<i>`) on the hub, where `strap_table` rides the snapshot so every machine's
  `player_table` (and so `pinned_pose`) names the same table. Only one person is ever on a table.
- **Both ways on and off are holds**, timed by `game._tick_table_holds` on `carry_hold` from the
  player's `wants_interact` (`Player._pinned_step` reports E while strapped). The HUD ring says
  STRAPPING IN / GETTING UP. E has to be let go in between (`_table_hold_gate`), so the press that
  straps you in never also stands you up. A prompt starting with "Hold E" is never a tap (the HUD
  already draws those as `[Hold E]`, and `Player._local_step` no longer fires `interact_count`
  for one), so the table's other taps -- operate, place a teammate -- still work.
- Strapped in, your arms are by your sides: the first-person hands and the held stack are hidden
  in first person and in third (`Player.refresh_held_visuals`), and **every light you carry goes
  out** -- the torch and the soft bubble in the head -- or they light your own face up for whoever
  leans over you (`Player.refresh_own_lights`, driven by `on_table` on every machine). Neither
  touches `flashlight_on`, so getting up leaves the torch exactly as you left it.
- `refresh_downed_visuals` only hides the body for a *downed* patient on the table, who has a lying
  `PlayerBody` standing in; a strapped surgeon's own body lies there for everyone else to see.
  `_update_down_pose` draws it at the table top, like that stand-in, not at the player node, which
  `pinned_pose` parks 0.8 m up the table so the camera sits at the head end.
- **Which way it lies.** A table's long axis is its local X with the head end at -X (that is where
  `pinned_pose` puts the camera, and `look_up_from_table` faces it down +X at its own feet). The
  human rig's "Lying" clip runs along its own Z, head at +Z, so the drawn body takes a quarter
  turn, `Player.LYING_CLIP_YAW` (the primitive fallback is a standing model tipped onto its back,
  head toward its local -Z, so `LYING_FALLBACK_YAW` turns it the other way), plus
  `LYING_ALONG_OFFSET` up the table so the 1.5 m body sits in the middle of the 2.2 m top with its
  head where the eyes are. All of it comes off `game.player_table_yaw()`, never the player node's
  own yaw, which follows the strapped player's mouse. straptest measures the head, hips and foot
  bones against the table's axis at five yaws.
- Your own body is normally drawn to nobody. `Player.set_dev_body(on)` shows it out in the world
  on its ordinary layers (not the mirrors' `LightRooms.SELF`) and keeps the carry camera from
  switching it off again; driving Dr. Botsworth turns it on, and hides your first-person arms so
  they do not float over the table in his view.
- Tests: `tools/straptest.tscn` (headless), `tools/strapshot.tscn` (the smoke look: shots into
  `tools/strap_shots/`, run through `tools
eview.bat 2 "SMOKE" -Scene res://tools/strapshot.tscn`
  so no window ever takes focus).

```

- **Saw** (host): a cone of 38 degrees around the aim from the eyes (yaw from `rotation.y`, pitch
  from `head.rotation.x`), the nearest monster or standing player within `SAW_REACH` plus its
  radius, with a clear line (`C.L_WORLD`). Monster: `take_hit(dir, 1, "saw:<name>")`; `"killed"` ->
  `game.kill_monster(m)` (pays nothing); `"immune"` -> `combat_clang`. Player:
  `game.damage_player(q, 1, "saw:<name>", knock)` unless invulnerable or in god mode. Every
  connecting hit (the Night Nurse included) rolls `breaks()`; a snap clears the saw's slot, plays
  `combat_snap` and says "X's bone saw snapped.". Noise 0.9 at the hit (kind "saw"), 0.3 through
  air ("swing").
- **Jab** (host): a 30 degree cone within `JAB_REACH`. A teammate: one vial, `knock_out(q, 8)`. A
  monster that is not capturable (the Night Nurse): nothing used, "The needle will not go in.".
  Already sedated: nothing. `can_sedate(m)`: one vial and `sedate(SEDATE_SECONDS)`. Otherwise
  nothing used, `m.alert_to(p)`, "It shrugged off the needle.".
- `use` is refused while downed, stunned, carrying or carried, dragging or operating. The host
  cooldown is 0.8 x the item's cooldown; the clicking machine enforces the full one.
- **Drag**: every monster gets an `Area3D` child "CombatAim" (interact_id `mo_<id>`, a 0.9 x 0.7
  x 2.1 box centred 0.35 m up, in the monster's own space), on `C.L_INTERACT` only while
  `is_sedated(m)` and nobody drags it. Hold E for `DRAG_HOLD` with empty hands (host-simulated like
  carrying; progress shows through `Player.carry_hold`). While dragging the player walks at
  `DRAG_SPEED_K`, cannot sprint, shove, use, drop or change slots, and `_update_aim` offers only
  `Strap the X to the table` on a free patient table (aim id = the table's interact id) or `Put
  the X down`. Hit (`damage_player`), shoved, knocked out, downed, dead or gone: the monster is let
  go where it lies. Waking while dragged (`is_sedated` false): dropped, turned to the dragger,
  `alert_to`, `game.monster_hit_player(m, q)`.
- **`monster_pin(m)`**: origin on the floor under the middle of the body, `DRAG_BEHIND` behind the
  dragger; basis = the dragger's yaw, so the pin's -Z points at the dragger and the body lies along
  Z, feet toward -Z, head toward +Z. Not dragged: the monster's own transform. A monster with a
  `dragged_by` field places itself there every frame on every machine; `start_drag`,
  `drop_dragged` and `strap` set and clear `m.dragged_by`, and combat clears a stale one.
- **Strap**: `strap_problem(ti)` is "" in `Phase.SHIFT` with no case on the table and no crew
  heading there. The case is exactly `game.add_case({table, patient_id: m.kind, ailment_id:
  "dissection", monster: true, flags: {sedation: lerp(0.35, 1.0, sedation_left / 75), snapped to
  0.01}})`; then `game.monsters.erase(id)`, `on_monster_removed(m)`, `m.queue_free()` (no death
  effect, no `monster_killed` event), `combat_strap` and "X strapped the Y to the table.".
- **Wind-ups** (hands sweep, `scripts/combat/windup.gd`, every machine): every shove, jab and saw
  swing goes WINDUP -> STRIKE -> RECOVER. `WINDUP_TIME` jab 0.35 s, saw 0.3 s; the shove charges
  while held: `SHOVE_MIN` 0.2 s (a tap), full at `SHOVE_FULL` 0.9 s, fires by itself at `SHOVE_MAX`
  1.5 s; charge `c` = (held - 0.2) / 0.7 clamped. `STRIKE_TIME` shove 0.16 / jab 0.18 / saw 0.22,
  `RECOVER_TIME` 0.36 / 0.32 / 0.36. The hit resolves on the host **at the strike** (`_swing`,
  `_jab`, `strike_shove`), so the target is checked then (a monster that got up during a jab's
  wind-up shrugs it off). Cooldowns (unchanged values) start at the strike, and at a cancel. While
  winding: walk speed, no sprint, no slot change, no drop. Hit, shoved, knocked out, downed, stunned,
  carried, carrying, dragging, operating or in Hive Eyes: the host cancels with no strike.
- **Shove** (`game.player_shoved(p, charge := -1.0)`): charge 0 (a tap) is the old shove (2 s stun);
  a charged shove stuns a capturable monster `lerp(2.0, 3.5, c)` s with `lerp(1.05, 1.9, c)` m of push
  (`Monster.shoved(dir, charge)`) and knocks a player back `lerp(11, 16, c)`; noise `0.6 + 0.25 c`.
  -1 is the instant shove the `Player.shove_count` counter still triggers (tests, old callers).
  Wind-ups emit noise 0.3 ("windup") and a charging shove 0.3..0.65 ("charge") every 0.4 s.
- **Network**: the owner starts the wind-up on the input and calls the reliable RPCs
  `Combat._rpc_windup(k, seq)` / `_rpc_release(seq, held)` (client -> host; a host-local player or bot
  calls `host_begin` / `host_release` directly). The host refuses (busy, cooling down, wrong item) with
  `cb_cancel`, else broadcasts `cb_windup {id, k, s}`; at the strike `cb_swing {id, k, s, c}`; a cancel
  `cb_cancel {id, s, cd}`. The shove's held seconds are capped to `min(claim, host-measured time
  between the two events + HOST_CHARGE_SLACK 0.3, SHOVE_MAX)`; a held shove the host never hears
  released fires at `SHOVE_MAX + 0.4`. Others show at least `MIN_SHOWN_WINDUP` (0.15 s) of a wind-up
  whose strike arrived in the same frame. `cb_stun {m, s}` starts a monster's stun window on every
  machine. `net_state()` (`g.cb`) is `{}` or `{s: [monster ids]}` (the fallback sedated set only).
  Drags ride in `Player.report_full` as `dm`. Nothing else crosses the wire (the carry camera is local).
- **Stun window** (`stun_window.gd`): from the host's shove to `s` seconds later: stagger pushed 1.7x
  for 0.3 s, then down (RigShaper `daze` 1: knees buckle, slumped, head hanging, arms dangling),
  `hands_dazed` every 1.25 s within 22 m, and for the last `RISE_WARNING` 0.6 s `rise` 0..1: it
  jerks upright with `hands_rise`. No HUD; holding anesthetic at a jabbable monster the crosshair
  prompt reads "[Click] Jab it" (`hud.gd` shows prompts that start with "[" as they are).
- Wind-up sounds (`tools/gen_audio_hands.mjs`): `hands_windup_01/_02` (quiet at the player for
  teammates), `hands_charge` (rising, stopped at the strike), `hands_full` (the charge maxed).
- Sounds (`tools/gen_audio_combat.mjs`): `combat_swing_01/_02`, `combat_jab_swish`,
  `combat_hit_01/_02`, `combat_clang`, `combat_snap`, `combat_jab`, `combat_needle_fail`,
  `combat_drag`, `combat_strap`.
- Tests: `tools/combattest.tscn` (headless, dev room; wind-up cases at the end),
  `tools/combatshot.tscn` (windowed shots to `tools/combat_shots/`), `tools/carrycamtest.tscn`,
  `tools/gameshot.tscn -- --only=hands`, nettest scenario `combat` (wind-ups seen before strikes,
  the capped charge).

```

- **Socket axes** (every hand, first and third person): origin in the palm, -Z the fingers, +Y out
  of the palm, +X the hand's right. A grip maps the model's `fwd` to -Z and `up` to +Y with `pos` in
  the palm. "palm" things lie on an open, palm-up hand; "fist" handles (saw, forceps, reflex hammer,
  EpiPen) sit in a closed hand, thumb up. `hands: 2` (bulky loot, the guide) sit
  between both palms. `HeldFirstPerson` (`Head/FX/Camera/HeldFirstPerson`) and `HeldThirdPerson`
  (`Body/HeldThirdPerson`) keep their paths: each frame they are moved onto the socket, and their
  child `Held` carries the grip transform (first person: two-handed things fit 0.22 m, big loot
  0.13 m; third person two-handed things 0.55 m).
- **First person**: right hand the torch (thumb up), left hand the selected stack; two-handed things
  take both hands and the torch tucks down at the right. Poses (camera space, `hand_poses.gd`) blend
  the wind-up / strike / recover of `combat.action_of`; walk bob, sway lagging the mouse, a 0.38 s
  lower-and-raise when the selected kind changes, lowered while sprinting, pulled back up to 0.17 m
  when a short ray fan (every 0.05 s) finds a wall within 0.62 m. x/y scale with `fov_k`
  (`Player.apply_fov`).
- **The arms seam**: `fp_arms.make_arm(side, colour) -> Node3D` is the only builder: origin at the palm
  socket, sleeve toward +Z, optional children `Rig/Fingers` (+`Mid`) and `Rig/Thumb` for `set_curl`.
  The human model's arms replace it there.
- **Third person, the rig seam**: `rig_map.gd` names the rig's torso, head and arm bones, the arms'
  rest directions and the hand socket offset on each arm bone (Kenney has no hand bones), and the pose
  table (arm directions in skeleton space, +Z forward, the body's right -X; torso pitch / yaw;
  weights): `hold`, `hold_both`, `carry`, `drag`, `saw_windup` / `saw_strike`, `jab_windup` /
  `jab_strike`, `shove_charge` / `shove_strike`. `body_poser.gd` (a SkeletonModifier3D after the
  AnimationPlayer) points the arms and leans the torso over the looped idle / walk / sprint clips.
  A new rig is an entry in `RigMap.RIGS`. A body without a matching rig (the capsule placeholder, a
  dev dummy) keeps `HeldThirdPerson` at `BodyHands.FIXED_ATTACH`. The local player's body only
  animates while the carry camera shows it. The jab shows a syringe in the hand (both views).
- **The human rig (2026-09-14, HUMAN HOOK)**: `RigMap.HUMAN` (picked first by `detect()`) is the Blender
  surgeon: `generic: true`, `bones` torso `chest`, arms `upperarm.*`, plus `fore` (forearms), `hand_bone`
  (`hand.*`, where `HandR`/`HandL` and the grip sockets go, palm 0.055 m along the bone) and
  `torso_chain` (spine, chest, upperchest share the lean). `RigMap.pose_of(rig, name)` reads a rig's own
  `poses` over `POSES` (the human's `carry`, `hold`, `hold_both`). With `generic`, `body_poser.gd` turns
  bones in skeleton space: the forearm points along the pose direction, the upper arm hangs 0.65 lower
  unless the arm is raised. `body_hands.gd` plays `Idle`, `Jog` (moving; the players' 3.4 m/s), `Sprint`,
  `Walk` at 1.45x (carrying, dragging, winding up), `Crawl` (downed; frozen when not moving), `Carried`,
  `Lying` (on the table), and the one-shots `PickUp` (an interact aimed at `it_*`) / `Interact` when an
  interact comes in standing still. `body_hands.lies_by_clip()` tells `Player._update_down_pose` not to
  tip the body; carried, the body is placed each frame by `Player.human_carried_pose(carrier)`: `HUMAN_CARRIED_SHOULDER` (-0.15, 1.535, 0.03)
  in the carrier's frame and yaw, mirrored (x scale -1: the clip is authored over a right shoulder), so the Carried clip's belly lands on the carrier's LEFT shoulder; corpses.gd places a carried human body the same way and a seal/monster body across the shoulders at `SHOULDER_AT` (-0.38, 1.62, 0.18), where the furnace roll-off starts. The carrier's `carry` pose wraps the LEFT arm across the legs; the right arm stays free. The first-person arms stay `fp_arms`.
- **Opt-in shoulder and front cameras** (2026-09-18): with the `camera` setting on "shoulder" (the
  settings screen's Camera row, or F5 anywhere) the same rig below runs in ordinary play too, at
  `PLAY_ARM` (0.5, 0.3, 1.35). On "front" the rig's yaw frame turns half round (`_orbit`, eased over
  `ORBIT_TIME` 0.55 s, passing the player's right side) to `FRONT_ARM` (0, 0.1, 2.3) and `Head/FX`'s
  basis slerps from the head's look to looking back at the upper chest (`FRONT_LOOK_DROP` below the
  eye), so the camera travels round rather than cutting; going back to first person unwinds it as it
  goes into the head. Facing the player (`front_view()`) the HUD skips the crosshair and
  `aim_segment` is the head's own ray. The torch always follows the head, never the camera. Carrying
  or dragging swing back behind to their arms; `wants()` still
  gives the head back while operating, in Hive Eyes, downed, carried, on the table or dead. The
  local held stack shows in the body's hand while the body shows (`_held_tp`). First person stays
  the default. Test: `tools/controlstest.tscn` ("over-the-shoulder camera").
- **Carry camera** (`scripts/camera/carry_camera.gd`): while the local player carries a downed player
  or a body, or drags a monster (setting "shoulder"), `Head/FX` eases (0.4 s, smootherstep) over the
  RIGHT shoulder (the load rides the left), framed like a flagship third-person game: the carrier on
  the left third, the crosshair clear. In the player's yaw frame: a `PIVOT` (0, -0.2, 0.12) from the
  eye (the upper back), then `CARRY_ARM` (0.5 right, 0.34 up, 1.15 back) -- at level pitch the camera
  sits (0.5, 0.14, 1.27) from the eye -- or `DRAG_ARM` (0.58, 0.72, 1.5) with a 0.2 rad downward look.
  The up/back part of the arm swings around the pivot by `ORBIT_K` (0.45) of the look pitch (looking
  down lifts it, looking up lowers it) and its back reach shortens up to 25% looking up
  (`rest_offset(arm, pitch)` gives the wall-free offset); the camera always looks where the head
  looks. Switching carry/drag eases the arm (6/s). Sphere casts (r 0.16) run head -> pivot ->
  shoulder -> camera: a wall beside moves it in over the head, a wall behind pulls it toward the
  head; shortening is instant, growing back 2.5 m/s, a teleport snaps. After a body goes into the
  furnace it lingers 2.5 s (`linger()`). The first-person hands and held
  stack hide (the camera's cull mask drops `HANDS_LAYER`), the local body shows (no shadows) unless the
  camera is within 0.55 m of the head, the flashlight stays at the head pointed along the camera. The
  aim ray (`aim_segment`) runs along the camera's line from where it passes the head, reaching
  `C.INTERACT_RANGE` from the head, so nothing between the camera and the head is aimed at and the
  host's reach check is unchanged. Local only. Carrying bulky loot does not switch it on.

## The human models (2026-09-14, art/human)

`scripts/human/human_model.gd` (static): the Blender humans for players, Bob, the downed player and the
paramedics. Every user keeps its Kenney or primitive path when the asset is missing.

```gdscript
HumanModel.available(variant) -> bool      # surgeon_a|b|c, bob, paramedic_a|b; false when HumanModel.disabled
HumanModel.surgeon_for(peer_id) -> String  # SURGEONS[(peer_id - 1) mod 3]
HumanModel.spawn(variant, tint := BAKED_TINT, own_skin := false) -> Node3D   # Assets root (faces -Z), shader materials, TopRolled hidden
HumanModel.set_tint(root, colour) / cloth_of(root) / skin_of(root)
HumanModel.piece(root, name) / show_piece(root, name, on) / skeleton(root) / anim_player(root)
HumanModel.loop_clips(root)                # all clips loop except Interact / PickUp (library shared per variation)
HumanModel.sample_clip(skel, anim, t) / bone_global(skel, bone) / chain_to(node, ancestor) / turn_bone(skel, bone, q)
```

- Assets keys (made in-house): `char/human_surgeon_a|b|c`, `patient/human_bob`, `crew/human_paramedic_a|b`
  (`assets/models/characters/human/<variant>.glb`, scale 1, yaw 180). The Sonographer keeps the Kenney
  `patient/human` rig; the Hive and the Sonographer get their own models later.
- Materials: `shaders/human_cloth.gdshader` (`tint` recolours the scrubs by luminance from mask R,
  `baked_tint` #3d8f80; mask G reflective strips) and `shaders/human_skin.gdshader` (`pallor`, `grey`,
  `infect` / `infect_from` / `infect_full` on UV2, `gash`, `wound`, `vein_glow`). Players share one skin
  material per variation; patients get their own.
- Pieces, sites, clips and speeds: `art/human/README.md`.

## Dissection (dissection worker, sweep 3)

Strapped monsters on the patient tables (`scripts/dissection/`, `game.dissection`). A monster case is
an ordinary `game.cases` entry: `{table, patient_id: "hive" | "sonographer", ailment_id: "dissection",
monster: true, flags: {sedation}}` plus `doses` (re-doses given). The surgery systems operate it like
any patient; everything below is host authoritative.

```gdscript
# Procedures (scripts/procedures.gd)
PATIENTS.hive / .sonographer        # monster: true (name, full_name, weight, blurbs.dissection)
AILMENTS.dissection                   # monster_only: true; steps
    # {id "open", "Saw open the skull", bone_saw, uses 0, game "saw", variant "skull", site "skull"}
    # {id "harvest", "Pull out the brain", forceps, uses 0, game "forceps", variant "brain", site "brain"}
Procedures.is_monster(patient_id) / is_monster_only(ailment_id)
Procedures.human_patients() -> ["bob", "seal"]    # roll(), the dev panel, the loop's extra call, the guide
Procedures.monster_patients() -> ["sonographer", "hive"]
# roll() and patient_ailments() never return a monster or dissection (same results as before).

# game.dissection (scripts/dissection/dissection.gd), child "Dissection" of Game
owns_case(c) -> bool / owns_table(table) -> bool      # every machine
sedation(c) -> float                                    # host: precise; clients: replicated (hundredths)
static sedation_state(s) -> "under" | "stirring" | "awake"   # STIR 0.75, AWAKE 0.35
static dose_amount(n) -> float                          # DOSE * DOSE_FALLOFF^n = 0.6 * 0.6^n
static brain_kind(patient_id) -> "brain_hive" | "brain_sonographer"
table_prompt(p, table) -> String                        # game._table_prompt hands monster tables here
table_used(p, table) -> bool                            # host, from game._proxy_used: true = it was a re-dose
redose(p, table) -> float                               # host: one vial from p's hands; returns the sedation added
on_case_finished(c, won)                                # host, from game.finish_case
spawn_brain(patient_id, quality, pos) -> Node           # host: game.brains.spawn_brain, else a plain loot item
dev_strap(kind, sedation := 1.0, table := -1) -> int    # host: tests and the dev panel (request "strap_monster")
set_sedation(case_id, s)                                # host, tests
last_brain: {kind, quality, pos, node}                  # tests
SEDATION_SECONDS 120, SAW_MULT 2.5, THRASH_BOTCH 1.5, THRASH_EVERY 3.0, SHRIEK_NOISE 0.7, REMOVE_AFTER 6.0
```

- **Sedation** falls from 1 to 0 in 120 s, 2.5x while the saw is held in the kerf. The host keeps the
  precise value and writes `flags.sedation` snapped to 0.05 (so the case field is not resent every
  tick); the global snapshot field `dx` = `{s: {"<case id>": hundredths}}` for every monster case on a
  table, and clients write it back into their case flags right after the cases apply, so the
  surgery system's stir code (`flags.sedation`) and the body read the same value everywhere.
- 0.35..0.75 the surgery system's existing stirs. Under 0.35 awake: the body thrashes against the
  straps (every machine, from the sedation), shrieks every 3.5-6.5 s (`emit_noise(table, 0.7,
  "shriek")`, event `dx_shriek`), and while someone operates `surgery_botch(1.5)` every 3 s.
- **Re-dose:** E on the table holding anesthetic (any hand; the selected stack first) re-doses instead
  of operating, also while someone else operates. Prompt: `Re-dose <name> (sedation 42%, +36%)`;
  otherwise `Operate: <step> (sedation 42%)` / `!<reason> (sedation 42%)`. Event `dx_dose`.
- **Brain condition** is the case's `vitals`: `_sim_shift` does not drain it, and the host clamps it
  so it never rises (the +8 of `surgery_step_done` is taken back). At 0 the case is lost ("The brain
  is ruined."). Winning the last step: `spawn_brain(kind, condition / 100, pos)` at the specimen tray
  beside the head (+0.12 m), `game.mark_db(patient_id, "harvested")` (sweep 4a chunk 4: unlocks
  tier 3 of the database terminal for that species), event `dx_flatline`, the case becomes
  `stable` and is removed 6 s later (dead cases too). `ShiftLoop.pay_for` pays 0; monster cases
  never block clocking out.
- **Bodies** (`PatientBody.create` dispatches `Procedures.is_monster(id)` to
  `scripts/dissection/monster_builder.gd`; the node is a normal `PatientBody`): lying along X, head
  -X, sites `injection`, `skull`, `brain`, leather straps over chest/arms, hips/wrists, thighs, shins
  (sized for the 0.7 m OR table). Flags `skull_open` (the cap lifts off along the cut over 0.9 s and
  lies bone side up beside the head), `brain_removed` (empty cavity; the body flatlines), `sedation`.
  `site_section("skull")` = `{half_up, half_side, axis_depth, shape}`; `site_section("brain")` also
  carries `half_u`, `brain_radii`, `brain_seed`, `brain_y`, `tray` (site-local Vector3) and `table_up`.
  Body meta `dx_brain_hidden` (set by the brain step while it draws the moving brain). The head is
  always this file's own (it opens); the body is `make_lying(kind)` from `Monster` or
  `scripts/monsters/monster_model.gd` when the copy has its rig: scaled to the 2 m table (the
  Sonographer 0.9), arms in at the sides (RigShaper cfg `lying_spread`), the rig's `Head` node hidden.
  The openable head sits at the rig's head bone, face up, wearing the body's own skin material and
  the walking look's face (`scripts/dissection/monster_rig_look.gd`: the Sonographer's sealed, stitched
  sockets, brow and large ears; the Hive's filmed eyes, jowls, open mouth and fringe of hair);
  face pieces past the cut ride the cap. Fit constants (scale, head bone, straps) live in
  `RigLook.RIG`; `tools/dissectiontest` checks the head bone against them. Thrashing turns the rig's
  arm and leg bones (`strap_thrash.gd`, a SkeletonModifier3D after the shaper), heaves the body and
  pulls the straps over the lifting limbs taut. Without the rig: primitives (the Hive a greenish
  patient in a teal gown, the Sonographer taller, pink-grey, blank-faced, in a white coat).
- **Minigames:** `saw.gd` variant `skull` (layers Scalp/Bone/Dura, no tourniquet, steady scalp bleed,
  finishes `{skull_open: true, cut_quality}`; the saw model is hidden until someone saws). `forceps.gd`
  variant `brain` hands every call to `scripts/dissection/brain_forceps.gd`: clamp each nerve at its
  ring and draw it in along itself (yanking tears: 2.0), take the brain, lift it straight out (scraping
  the bone: 1.5 per 0.5 s), carry it to the tray (dropping: 3.0); finishes `{brain_removed: true}`.
  Net state keys `x y j c k s g l bx bz st h r dr p`. Limb and gunshot behaviour and their self-test
  output are unchanged; `--selftest=saw` and `--selftest=forceps` also run the variants.
- OR screen: panels carry `monster` and `sedation`; the canvas tags the number "BRAIN", shows
  `SEDATION n%` (amber stirring, red and blinking AWAKE), and the status line says BRAIN HARVESTED /
  BRAIN RUINED.
- Sounds `dissection_shriek`, `dissection_strap` (creaks while thrashing, local), `dissection_snap`,
  `dissection_plop`, `dissection_crack`, `dissection_inject` (`tools/gen_audio_dissection.mjs`).
- Tests: `tools/dissectiontest.tscn` (headless; `-- --shots` windowed into `tools/dissection_shots/`),
  minigame self-tests, nettest scenario `dissection`.

## Networking (net worker, sweep 2)

`Net` autoload (`scripts/net.gd`):

```gdscript
Net.host(player_name, port = C.DEFAULT_PORT) -> String       # "" or an error; ENet, synchronous
Net.join(address, port = C.DEFAULT_PORT, player_name = "") -> String   # answers via joined_ok / join_failed
Net.host_steam(player_name = "") -> String   # friends-only lobby; answers via host_ready / host_failed
Net.join_steam(lobby_id, player_name = "") -> String         # answers via joined_ok / join_failed
Net.invite_friends() -> bool                 # Steam overlay invite dialog for the current lobby
Net.steam_available() -> bool                # extension loaded AND Steam client running AND init ok
Net.leave(); Net.is_host(); Net.my_id(); Net.peer_ids(); Net.name_for(id)
Net.names       # peer id -> display name (Steam personas on the Steam backend)
Net.local_name  # survives reset(); the name this machine introduces itself with
Net.backend     # "solo" | "enet" | "steam"
Net.bytes_sent / Net.bytes_received          # ENet wire bytes, for measurements
signal roster_changed, joined_ok, join_failed(reason), host_left, host_ready, host_failed(reason),
       invite_accepted(lobby_id)             # Steam invite / "Join game" / +connect_lobby
```

- Never reference a GodotSteam class or the `Steam` singleton directly outside `net.gd`: the
  extension may be missing, and a direct reference breaks parsing.
- Steam is not initialised in headless runs (tests); `--steam` forces it, `--no-steam` skips it.
- Lag simulation for a joining ENet client: `--net-lag=MS --net-jitter=MS --net-loss=0..1`, or
  `Net.set_lag_simulation()` before `join()`.

Replication (networking section of `scripts/game.gd`):

- Host -> each client, 20 Hz, unreliable, **replicated per field with acks** (netfix, sweep 2
  integration). The state is `g` (entity 0: global fields, with each table's surgery state
  flattened into `sg<table>.*` and `ms<table>.*`, the cases as `cs` (ids), `c.<id>` (the case
  without vitals) and `v.<id>` (its vitals), and the shift loop as `lp.*`), `pl`
  (Player.report_full per peer), `mo` (Monster.report), `ct` (open containers: id -> `{}`) and
  `it` (WorldItem.report); the `id` field of reports is stripped (the key says it).
  - The host tracks, per client and per field, the confirmed value and the value in flight, and
    sends only fields the client lacks. Lost messages (a later one acked 100 ms-newer without
    them, or no ack within srtt + 4 rttvar, 250 ms to 2 s, counted from the client's latest ack
    packet) make their fields unknown, so they go again with current values. Every message holds
    absolute values; the client keeps the newest sequence per field, so any subset in any order
    converges. There are no keyframes and no message depends on another.
  - Existence is field `@` (a hash of the entity's field names, -1 once removed); the client
    uses an entity only when it holds exactly those fields. When the field names change the host
    sends the whole entity; a field that left the report travels as `Game.NET_GONE` (null is an
    ordinary value). `g` is split into groups whose names change together (`""` fixed fields,
    `cs` cases, `lp` loop, `s<table>` surgery), each its own entity; a client keeps using a
    group's last whole copy while a newer one is incomplete.
  - **No message exceeds `Game.NET_MSG_BYTES` (1000 estimated; 1016 serialized seen)**: one datagram on ENet
    (MTU 1392) and one segment on Steam (SteamNetworkingSockets MTU about 1200; its 512 KB
    `MAX_STEAM_PACKET_SIZE` is only the reliable/segmented limit, and an unreliable message split
    into segments is lost if any segment is). Priority per tick: `g`, `pl`, `mo`, `ct`, `it`.
    Bursts (clock-in loot, late joiners) spread over ticks: at most `NET_TICK_BYTES` (4000) per
    client per tick and `NET_WINDOW_BYTES` (16000) unacknowledged, one message per tick while the
    window is full, one every 4 ticks while a client has been silent for 1.5 s. A single field
    bigger than a message still goes alone (fragmented): keep report fields small.
  - Clients ack in `_player_state([newest seq, 64-bit mask of the ones before], Player.report_state())`.
    Every 10 s a client re-applies its whole replica to its nodes locally (no bandwidth).
  - `game.net_counters`: host `{msgs, bytes, acked, lost, max_msg}` (max_msg with `net_measure`),
    client `{msgs, stale}`; nettest `--stats` prints them.
- **Reports must be quantized and must not share mutable data with the live object** (return
  copies of arrays and dictionaries), or unchanged things resend forever or changes go unseen.
  `apply_remote(d)` / `apply_remote_full(d)` always receive the whole merged report, never a
  partial one. A report may omit a field (WorldItem omits `p`/`q` inside a container).
- `Player.report_state() -> Array` (client -> host) is positional; see its comment.
- Anything new that must reach clients: add it to a report (continuous state) or send a reliable
  `_event` (one-off). Do not add new full-state RPCs.
- **Exception, deliberately (sweep 4a chunk 4):** `game.database` (the terminal's data) is small,
  changes rarely and only a handful of clients ever look at it (whoever has the terminal open), so
  it is neither a report field nor pushed unprompted. `mark_db` sends a one-off `_event`
  `"db_update" {kind, field}` to everyone when a field flips; a client's terminal additionally asks
  for a full copy on open (`game.request_database_sync()` -> `any_peer` reliable rpc
  `_rpc_request_database` -> the host answers that one peer with `_event` `"db_full" {all}`).
- `game.waiting_peers` (peer id -> true, replicated): peers that joined mid-shift. They exist as
  not-alive Players, `all_players_out()` skips them, and `start_lobby` spawns them. Anything that
  counts or revives dead players must skip them.
- A peer leaving: its hands drop where it stood through `_drop_hands_in_place` (no breakage),
  `surgery.end()` pauses its operation with progress kept.

Tests: `godot --headless --path . --script tools/nettest_run.gd` runs every multi-process
scenario (`-- --only=a,b`, `--lag=MS --jitter=MS --loss=P`, `--only=bandwidth`). Add a scenario
for anything that changes what crosses the wire.

## Brains (brains worker, sweep 3)

`game.brains` (`scripts/brains/brains.gd`, child "Brains" of Game on every machine; parts in
`scripts/brains/`: `brain_model.gd`, `blender.gd`, `echo_view.gd`, `hive_view.gd`).

```gdscript
game.brains.spawn_brain(kind: String, quality: float, pos: Vector3) -> Node   # host: a WorldItem on
    # whatever is under pos; value = base * quality (min $1); spoil clock starts now; squelch sound
Brains.is_brain(kind) -> bool              # "brain_hive", "brain_sonographer" (static)

game.brains.factor_of(stack_or_item) / age_of(stack_or_item)
game.brains.points(peer_id, path) -> float # path "hive" | "sonographer"; 0..3, steps of 0.25
game.brains.level(peer_id, path) -> int    # floor(points), 0..3
game.brains.add_points(peer_id, path, amount)   # host (the blender, dev, tests); the moment a path
    # first reaches level 1 it also grants that ability's slot (add_ability, below)
game.brains.on_reset()                     # host, from game.reset_money (game over, new session)

# SWEEP 4A (docs/SWEEP4A.md "Ability slots"): 4 ability slots per player, independent of how a
# level is earned (today: points/level above; grafting will source levels later, docs/backlog/
# SWEEP4B.md), so nothing here reads `_points` except through level()/points().
Brains.ABILITY_ID := {"sonographer": "echo", "hive": "hive_in"}   # path -> ability id (static)
game.brains.slots_for(peer_id) -> Array    # this player's 4 slots, ability id or "" (host authoritative,
    # replicated: net_state()["ab"]; the ability bar is local-only, so a client only really needs its own)
game.brains.add_ability(peer_id, id) -> bool    # host: id into the first empty slot; true if it was
    # already in a slot (no-op); false and unchanged once all 4 slots are full (refused, not swapped)
game.brains.slot_of(peer_id, id) -> int    # this player's slot index for id, or -1
game.brains.set_level(peer_id, id, lvl)    # host (tests, dev, later grafting): sets the level directly
    # (id must be "echo" / "hive_in") and grants the slot the same as reaching it through points
game.brains.ability_slot(p, slot_idx)      # host, from game.player_ability_slot (Alt+1..4): per-slot
    # dispatch, replacing the old best_path()/ability(p) (removed). Each slot's ability still cools
    # down on its own path's cooldown key (echo:<peer> / hive:<peer>), unaffected by which slot it
    # sits in. Pressing the slot again while its ability is active (Hive Eyes) ends it.

```

- **Brain items.** Loot kinds `brain_hive` ($150) and `brain_sonographer` ($350) in
  `loot_table.gd` with `brain: true`, fragile, not stackable, not bulky, no rooms / surfaces /
  containers (the loot spawner never picks them). The model is one merged mesh with the gold rim.
- **Spoil time `bt`** (world_time of the harvest): `WorldItem.bt` (default -1e6 = none; any value
  above -1e5 is a real clock, it may be negative early in a run), reported as `bt` (snapped 0.5);
  in a hand slot as `slots[i].bt`. Carried by `game.pickup_item`, `drop_selected`, `_drop_hands`
  (a violent drop cracks the brain like other fragile loot, the clock stays), `_drop_hands_in_place`
  and the dev room's `hand_over`. **Anything else that moves a stack between hands and the world
  must carry `bt` too.** The host stamps `bt = world_time` on any brain found without one (4 Hz).
- **The dumpster** is the existing sell bin (interact_id `sell_bin`, unchanged): its sign says
  DUMPSTER, its prompt `Sell X for $N at the dumpster` with the current value, `game.sell_selected`
  pays `current_value`. The HUD slot and the world item prompt show the current value (and the
  condition for brains).
- **Blender:** on a break-room counter top found with downward rays over `level_info.rooms` kind
  `break_room` (the free end nearest the time clock, backed toward the wall), else on a steel stand
  on free floor beside `level_info.economy.shop` (dev room), else near the clock. Placed two physics
  frames after a new `game.level`, same spot on every machine. Holding a brain selected: hold E
  (`interact_hold` 1.5 s; the host simulates it from `wants_interact` + `aim_id`, like the clock).
  Drinking: +1.0 fresh, +0.75 spoiling, +0.5 rotten to that path, capped at 3.0.
- **Alt+1..4 (sweep 4a):** fires that slot's ability through `ability_slot`; an empty slot (or the
  slot pressed again while its ability is active, other than ending Hive Eyes): "Nothing happens."
  (at most once a second). Cooldowns: Echo 20 s from the shriek, Hive Eyes 12 s from when the view
  ends (presses in the 0.5 s after a view ends are ignored). Not while downed; Hive Eyes not while
  carrying or operating. Scaling is literal: `12 + 6 * level` m and `2.5 + 0.75 * level` s for Echo,
  `20 + 10 * level` m and `5 + 2 * level` s for Hive Eyes, so a half point (level 0) already works
  at the base. R itself no longer fires an ability (docs/SWEEP4A.md "Controls"): it holds the
  built-in scanner instead (below), and the guide opens on E.
- **Echo** (host): `game.emit_noise(pos + 1.5 up, 1.2, "echo")`, event `br_echo {id, pos, r, s}`:
  everyone hears `brains_shriek` at pos (the shrieker hears it 2D); the shrieker's machine runs
  `echo_view.start`: a dark veil quad on the camera and at most 40 things / 150 mesh outlines
  (monsters red, other players white, surgical items teal, loot gold, containers dim) through walls
  (`depth_test_disabled`, `ignore_occlusion_culling`), lit as a 26 m/s wave passes. Freed when it ends.
  **Echo polish (sweep 4a chunk 4):** every machine that gets the `br_echo` event (not just the
  shrieker's) spawns a quick expanding ring (`Brains._spawn_echo_pulse`, a self-freeing tween on a
  torus, no state kept) at `pos` and starts a local one-shot pose timer
  (`Brains._echo_pose_until[shrieker peer] = world_time + 0.5`, not replicated -- every machine
  sets it the same way from the same reliable event) that leans the shrieker's `body_visual` back
  briefly (`Player._update_down_pose`'s tilt calc), so the shriek visibly comes from them too.
- **Hive Eyes** (host): the nearest `kind == "hive"` monster within range (through walls, not
  `is_sedated()`); `Player.hive_view = true` (report key `hv`), `br.hv[peer] = [monster id, end
  world_time]`, event `br_hive {id, on}`. Ends on time, its slot / E / Esc, the monster leaving
  `game.monsters` (killed, strapped) or `is_sedated()`, and the player's hp dropping, being downed,
  stunned or carried. While `hive_view` the Player ignores movement, mouse look, aim, use, shove,
  drop and interact (E bumps the Hive Eyes slot's `ability_slot_press`); remote copies droop the
  head and lean, and show a glazed-eyes glow (`Player._hive_glaze`, an emissive quad on the head,
  sweep 4a chunk 4 -- teammates only, toggled in `_remote_step`).
  **Fly-through (sweep 4a chunk 4, `scripts/brains/hive_view.gd`, local/cosmetic only):** `end_at`
  now carries `HiveView.FLIGHT_IN` (1.2 s) on top of `hive_seconds(lvl)`, so the duration timer
  only really starts once the flight lands. The local camera leaves the player's own camera
  transform and glides along `NavigationServer3D.map_get_path` (the default map; a straight line
  when none is found) to the Hive's eyes over `FLIGHT_IN`, looking ahead along the path;
  `hive_view._phase` is `"in"` (flying), `"settled"` (riding the eyes, the original sweep 3
  behaviour) or `"out"` (a `FLIGHT_OUT`, 0.3 s, glide back to wherever the body currently is).
  Ending is instant (no `"out"` phase) when the monster is gone, or when the local player's hp
  dropped since the flight started, or they are downed/carried (`hive_view._begin_end`'s own
  comparison against `_start_hp`, captured client-side -- nothing new was added to the wire for
  this). A quiet end (the slot again, or time running out) gets the `"out"` glide instead.
  **Known gap:** cycling between Hives at level 2+ and the hold-to-exit key are not wired up
  this pass (`hive_view._begin_cycle` exists but nothing calls it) -- see KNOWN_ISSUES.md.
- **Replication:** `net_state()` = `{"p": {peer: [hive, sonographer]}, "hv": {peer: [id, end]},
  "bh": {peer: progress}, "ab": {peer: [4 ability ids]}}` (copies, quantized; empty dictionaries
  when idle).
- Sounds `brains_squelch`, `brains_blend`, `brains_gulp`, `brains_shriek`, `brains_hive_in`,
  `brains_hive_out` (`tools/gen_audio_brains.mjs`).
- Tests: `tools/braintest.tscn` (headless; sweep 4a chunk 4 added the fly-through/fly-back timing
  cases), nettest scenario `brains`, `tools/brainshot.tscn` (windowed shots to `tools/brain_shots/`),
  `tools/perfprobe.tscn -- --brains`, `tools/controlstest.tscn` (sweep 4a chunk 1: crouch/jump,
  Alt+1..4 slot dispatch, the scanner), `tools/databasetest.tscn` (sweep 4a chunk 4: scan/harvest
  unlocking tiers, persistence across a wipe and a reload, a second peer's scan landing in the
  host's database, the guide binder and `read` action being gone).

### Grafting part one: eyes, vats and Eyeball Extraction (docs/GRAFTING.md, chunk A, 2026-09-18)

`scripts/grafting/eyes.gd` (`Eyes`, statics) and `vats.gd` (`Vats`, `game.vats`, child "Vats" of Game).
No graft, graft stand or Hive Eyes change yet (chunks B and C).

```gdscript
# Items: "scalpel", "eye_spoon" (ITEMS, surgical, reusable), "specimen_vat" (ITEMS, bulky: two hands),
#        "eye_hive", "eye_surgeon" (LootTable, sellable, `eye: true`).
Eyes.spoil_factor(age) / condition(f) / is_spoiled_factor(f)   # FRESH 40 s, ROTTEN 130 s, spoiled below 0.3 (can't be grafted)
Eyes.label(kind, owner)                                         # "Hive's eyeball" / "Zach's eyeball"
Eyes.pack(kind, owner, age, value) / unpack(x)                  # a vat's contents string
Vats.held_vat(p) -> int                                         # head slot of a vat in p's hands, -1
game.vats: item_used(p, item) / hand_put(p) / take_out(p, aim_id) / set_down(p, spot) / spot_free(i)
           eye_age(stack_or_item) / eye_factor(...) / eye_value(stack)   # value now, for the furnace
           spots (level_info.vat_spots, six: three per vat bench), on_level_built(info)
```

- **`x`** is a new small string on `WorldItem` and on a hand slot (like `bt`, it rides pickup, drop,
  throw, storage and the snapshot): a part's owner ("Zach"; "" means the Hive), or what a vat holds.
  An eye's spoil clock is `bt`, like a brain's. Going into a vat freezes the age in the vat's `x`;
  coming out rebuilds `bt`, so a vat stops the clock. `game.furnace_value` prices eyes by spoilage.
- **Inputs.** E on a vat (bench or dropped) with an eye selected puts it in; E aimed at nothing with a
  vat and an eye in hand does the same (aim id `vat_hand`). **V** (`vat_take`, its own input action,
  `Player.vat_count`, last element of the report array) takes the eye back out of the aimed vat, else
  the vat in your hands. E on a free bench spot (`Vats.Marker`, only aimable while you carry a vat)
  sets a carried vat down there.
- **The lab wall.** Two of the entrance OR's east-run lab stations are `lab_vat_bench` pieces (three
  vat spots each on the counter; shelves of jars, mostly heads, over them). `entrance.gd` records
  `spots.vat_benches`, `hospital_builder` turns them into `level_info.vat_spots`. On level build the
  host stands three empty vats on the first three spots and stocks a scalpel, an eye spoon and forceps on the
  OR's storage shelves (neither is in `_shift_item_ids`, so they last the run; a new run resets).
- **Eyeball Extraction** is the ailment `eye_extraction` (monster-only; steps scalpel "cut", eye
  spoon "scoop", scalpel "snip" and, since 2026-09-19, forceps "place" -- lifting the cut-free eye
  into the specimen vat standing on the table, `{"eye_in_vat": true}` -- all `game: "eye"` =
  `surgery/games/eye_ops.gd`, site `eye` on the Hive's left eyeball). `dissection._finish_eye` puts
  the eye in that vat when the flag is set, and only falls back to the operator's hand (or the floor
  by the head) when there is no vat to put it in. A strapped Hive stays `dissection` until its first step: `Dissection.ailment_for(case, p)`
  gives `eye_extraction` when p holds the scalpel, `dissection` for the bone saw (host: `_pick_ailment`
  in `table_used`; `SurgerySystem._step_for` for the prompt everywhere). The body keeps its key across
  the switch. Results `eye_cut`, `eye_out` (the socket empties), `eye_removed` (the Hive flatlines);
  sedation, stirring and thrash botches are unchanged and vitals are the eye's condition: at 0 the
  eye bursts. The last step puts an `eye_hive` (value 120 x condition) in the operator's hand
  (`Dissection.last_operator`, else on the specimen tray); the Hive dies on the table.
- **The eye minigames** (`eye_ops.gd`, reusable by the graft): cut = the saw-style violet marking ringed round the eye, left click lowers the scalpel, trace it and the cut opens along it, too fast or off the eye slips it out (click to lower again, cut kept, no damage); scoop = spoon on the cursor, click into the socket, circle it slowly (two turns), too fast slips; snip = eye resting over the socket seen from low, hold **W** (`Minigame.BUTTON_UP`, new bit in `buttons`) to pull it up and reveal the nerve, then click the nerve. ctx knobs: `no_fail` (never botches), `eye_kind`, `eye_radius`. Only a nick of the eyeball and a missed slice botch.
- Tests: `tools/grafttest.tscn` (headless).

### Grafting part one: the vat on the table and Eyeball Grafting (docs/GRAFTING.md, chunk C, 2026-09-18)

`scripts/grafting/grafts.gd` (`Grafts`, `game.grafts`, child "Grafts" of Game, every machine) and
`scripts/grafting/graft_eye.gd` (`GraftEye`, statics: the grafted eyeball on a body).

**Body parts are named "X's Y"** everywhere: `Eyes.label` gives "Hive's eyeball" / "Zach's eyeball",
from the part kind's `Eyes.NOUN` and the owner in `x`. Everything in `Eyes`, `Vats` and `Grafts`
works on a *part kind*, never on eyes as such, so part two's trachea (docs/GRAFTING_TRACHEA.md) can
be added through `Eyes.KINDS` / `NOUN` and `Grafts.PART_ABILITY` without a rewrite.

```gdscript
# where a vat stands on each patient table (vats.gd), worked out with the level on every machine
Vats.places            # [{position (on the table top), yaw, table: table index}], TABLE_VAT_OFFSET
Vats.place_free(i) / place_prompt(p, i) / set_down_on_table(p, i)
Vats.vat_on_table(table_index) -> WorldItem / place_of_table(ti) / nearest_place(pos, within)
# the graft (grafts.gd)
game.grafts.graft_of(peer_id) -> String      # "eye_hive" or ""; snapshot field "gf"
           table_prompt(q) / empty_table_prompt(q, ti)   # the offer and its refusals
           make_case(q) / on_step(case, result) / finish(case) / apply(peer, kind)
           local_lock() -> float             # -1 no graft, else how lit the eye is (the HUD tint)
```

- **The vat's place** is on the patient table's own steel, beside where the head goes and on the
  side the eye steps work (`TABLE_VAT_OFFSET`, `Game.OR_TABLE_TOP`). E with a carried vat stands it
  there (aim id `vattable_<i>`, armed only while you carry one); picking it back up is the ordinary
  world-item pickup, and the place holds a vat only for as long as someone leaves it there.
  2026-09-19: this replaced the little steel stand that used to sit beside each table.
- **The case.** `Procedures.AILMENTS.eye_graft` ("Eyeball Grafting", `player_only`), four steps, all
  `game: "eye"`, site `eye`: scalpel `cut`, eye spoon `scoop`, **forceps `grab`**, suture kit `stitch`.
  It runs through `scripts/downed/player_surgery.gd`, which already stands in as a game for the
  player table's surgery system; `is_graft()` is the difference. The case carries `in_kind/in_owner/
  in_value`, `out_kind/out_owner` and flags `{sedation: 1.0, no_fail: true, eye_kind, eye_kind_in,
  eye_radius}`, which `surgery_system._spawn_mg` copies into the minigame's ctx. **No botching.**
- **The offer** hangs off the table's existing prompt: `_table_prompt` -> `player_surgery.operate_
  prompt` -> `grafts.table_prompt` while somebody lies strapped there with no case. The refusals are
  "!No vat on the table.", "!The vat on the table is empty.", "!X's eyeball is
  spoiled.", "!X already has one.", "!X has two normal eyes.", "!You cannot operate on yourself." and
  "!Hold the scalpel to start the graft."; a free table with a loaded vat on it says
  "!Nobody is strapped to this table." to someone holding a scalpel, an eye spoon or the forceps. The case is
  created by the first `begin` (`player_surgery.start_graft`).
- **The swap.** The `grab` step's result (`eye_seated`) is the moment it happens: the forceps have
  just lifted the new eye out of the vat, so the eye that was in the socket is packed into the vat
  they emptied (fresh, age 0). So a graft is always a swap and never an empty socket. (Until
  2026-09-19 it happened at the `scoop`, which left you reaching into a vat that already held your
  own eye.)
- **Committed after the scoop.** `game.get_up_block` asks `player_surgery.graft_commit_block`, which
  refuses ("Not with your eye out.") from step 2 on. Before that the surgeon can hold E and go, which
  clears the case.
- **The eye minigames** gained three variants (`eye_ops.gd`): `stitch` is the cut's rules run over an
  already-open wound (it closes behind the needle and stitch marks appear, result `eye_stitched`),
  and `grab` / `place` are one game, `scripts/grafting/eye_seat.gd`, which `eye_ops.gd` builds as a
  child and hands every Minigame call to (the shape `forceps.gd` uses for `brain_forceps.gd`). It is
  one trip with the forceps, run in either direction:
  `grab` (the graft's step 3) takes the new eye (`eye_kind_in`) out of the specimen vat standing on
  the table and seats it in the socket, `{"eye_seated": true}`; `place` (the extraction's step 4)
  takes the cut-free eye out of the socket and drops it in the vat, `{"eye_in_vat": true}`.
  **One way to handle an eyeball, both ways round** (2026-09-19, after the extraction's proved too
  fiddly to finish): hold primary anywhere within `GRAB_R` (5.5 cm) of the eye and the jaws take it
  -- no aiming, no lowering, the forceps dip and lift by themselves -- drag it with the mouse (the
  nerve swings, but no speed and no distance can shake it out: neither step can be lost), and let
  go within `DROP_SOCKET` / `DROP_VAT` of where it has to go. It sinks home by itself, turning so a
  seated pupil faces out. Letting go anywhere else drops it back where it came from, with the hint
  saying so. Both rings are up from the first frame and the target's is drop-radius sized. No depth
  keys, no speed limit, no botches, and a dropped eye costs nothing. ctx knobs `no_fail`,
  `eye_kind`, `eye_kind_in`, `eye_radius`, and `vat` (the real `specimen_vat` on the table, which
  `surgery_system` looks up per machine: the game draws its own open copy where that one stands and
  hides the real one while the step runs). Every graft step shares `eye_ops.base_camera_pose()`, so
  the face never shifts between them and the vat is in the same shot as the socket.
- **The body holds still.** `player_body.set_ailment("eye_graft")` sets `still`: no breath, no idle
  Lying clip, no stir jolt, for as long as the graft is on the table. The site markers were measured
  off frame 0 of that clip, so it is also the only pose where the eye really is where the work plane
  says. Every machine builds the body from the same case, so it is still on all of them.
- **The body.** `scripts/downed/player_body.gd` is the lying stand-in for the graft too: new site
  `eye` (the LEFT eyeball, `GraftEye.local_offset` off `Site_eyes` on the head bone -- the *same*
  place the grafted eyeball hangs, so the socket you cut into is the one that ends up with the new
  eye in it), `parts`, and
  `set_eye(kind, out)` which the case drives per step (own eye -> empty socket -> the new one).
  `Player.stand_in` (every machine, from `player_surgery._refresh_stand_in`) keeps the strapped
  surgeon's own body from drawing on top of it.
- **The eye on the body.** There is no `surgeon_graft` GLB in the game, so `GraftEye` builds that
  look at runtime: `Human_Eye_L` is hidden and an eyeball with the item's own shader is hung on the
  head's `BoneAttachment3D` with a ring of stitches, so it follows every clip and shows in third
  person, on other players' screens, in the carry camera and in the Personnel mirrors.
  `Grafts._physics_process` puts it on and takes it off from the replicated `_graft`. It keys what it
  has drawn on the **human model instance**, not just the part kind, and re-attaches whenever the node
  is gone: a body_visual is thrown away and rebuilt whenever what it shows changes (getting up off the
  table, the mirror's own body), and the graft used to go with it and never come back.
  The eyeball is exactly the size and place of `Human_Eye_L` (`GraftEye.RADIUS`, `SIDE`), turned so
  its pupil (-Z) looks out of the face: the skeleton's front is +Z. `LOCK_IDLE` keeps a low ember on it.
- **The glow** is the Hive eye material's `Lock`, a new `instance uniform float lock` on the eye
  shader (0 a low pinpoint, 1 the whole ball lit). `Grafts` eases it from `LOCK_IDLE` to 1 while that
  player's `hive_view` is on, which is already replicated, so every machine agrees. The first-person
  tint reads the raw value (`local_lock`), not the floor.
- **The work lamp.** `Minigame.lamp_scale()` (default 1.0) is how much of the operating camera's work
  lamp a step wants; `surgery_system._update_camera` multiplies `LAMP_ENERGY` by it. The eye steps put
  the camera 0.3 m off the site, which is right on a Hive's dark head and bleaches a surgeon's pale
  face to white, so `eye_ops.lamp_scale()` returns 0.3 when the patient is a player.
- **The ability.** `Grafts.PART_ABILITY` maps `eye_hive` -> `hive_in`: finishing the graft calls
  `brains.set_level(peer, "hive_in", 1)` (the next free slot and the new-ability card), and swapping
  back calls the new `brains.clear_ability(peer, id)`, which empties the slot, zeroes the points and
  ends any Hive Eyes view in progress. A graft lasts the run, through death, and `grafts.on_reset()`
  clears it on a game over with the money and the brains.
- **Hive brains teach nothing now.** `Brains.blendable(kind)` is false for `brain_hive`; the blender
  refuses it ("!Blender: a Hive brain teaches nothing. Sell it.") and `drink` ignores it. Echo, the
  Sonographer brains and the blender are unchanged.
- **The first-person tell**: `scripts/grafting/graft_view.gd` (`main.graft_view`), a faint orange
  wash down the LEFT edge, stronger as `grafts.local_lock()` rises. It is its own CanvasLayer at 52,
  **above** the look pass's grain, vignette and teal grade (layer 50) that the HUD sits under -- a
  faint orange graded toward teal disappears completely. Local and cosmetic, from replicated state.
- Tests: `tools/grafttest.tscn` (the graft section: the stands, the refusals, the four steps with
  Dr. Botsworth operating, Hive Eyes 1 in and out, and not getting up after the scoop),
  nettest scenario `graft`.

### Ability bar (HUD, local-only, sweep 4a)

`scripts/hud.gd` `_draw_ability_bar`: 4 slots always shown small top-left of the item bar; holding
`ability_alt` (Alt) grows them into the bar over ~0.12 s (`Hud._alt_t`) while the item icons shrink
to a small row where the abilities were. Each icon: `Alt+N`, a cooldown sweep, level pips, a cost
tag (`Hud.ABILITY_COST`, e.g. Echo's "LOUD"), and while Alt is held, the ability's name and (greyed
out) why it cannot fire right now (`Hud._slot_reason`: cooling down, hands busy, no Hive in
range, downed). The first time an ability lands in a slot, a short card names it, what it does, its
key and its cost, and closes itself after 5 s or on any key (`Hud._card_until` / `_card_seen`).

### Scanner (docs/SWEEP4A.md "Scanner", sweep 4a)

Every player has a scanner built in: not an item, no slot. Hold `scan` (R) aimed at a monster to
scan it; the host checks range (`C.SCAN_RANGE`, 14 m) and a clear raycast from the camera each tick
(`game._tick_scan`, `game._scan_aim`) and accumulates progress over `C.SCAN_SECONDS` (3 s);
breaking range or line of sight resets it to 0. A completed scan marks that species `scanned` on the
host's in-memory database (below) and tells the scanner "Entry updated" (`game.tell`). The HUD ring
at the crosshair (`Hud._draw_scan_ring`) and the beep are local, client-side cosmetics computed the
same way every machine computes its own aim/prompt (`Player._update_scan_progress`); they are not
noise events (monsters cannot hear a scan).

`game.database: Dictionary` (kind -> `scripts/database/db_record.gd` `DbRecord {kind, sighted,
scanned, harvested}`), host-only. `game.db_record(kind) -> DbRecord` creates one on first touch;
`game.mark_db(kind, field)` is the only thing that sets a field, since it also saves to disk and
tells clients (see "Database terminal" above). "Sighted" is broader than scanning: any monster
within scan range and visible (frustum + line of sight, `Perception.in_view`) to any living player
marks it sighted, whether or not anyone is aiming at it to scan. Sweep 4a chunk 4 added
`harvested`, disk persistence and the terminal that reads all three.

## Doors and the per-shift wings (doors worker, 2026-09-14)

Every doorway has a door; the wings behind the entrance building's gates are rebuilt for every
shift. Files: `scripts/level/door_plan.gd` (which door where, as data), `scripts/doors/door.gd`
(one door node), `scripts/doors/door_models.gd` (procedural meshes), `scripts/doors/doors.gd`
(`game.doors`), `scripts/level/wing_loader.gd` (`game.wing_loader`), `tools/gen_audio_doors.mjs`,
`tools/doortest.*`.

### The map

```gdscript
MapGen.generate(run_seed, wing_seed := -1)   # -1: the run seed (shift 1). Entrance, neutral area and
                                             # the wing count come from the run seed only
MapGen.wing_seed_for(run_seed, generation) -> int   # generation 1 -> run_seed
MapGen.ENTRANCE_ORIGIN = Vector2i(32, 34)    # every run, every shift; the map is always 92 x 74
gen.doors: [{id "dr_<x>_<y>", kind "hinged"|"double"|"gate"|"auto"|"sliding", tiles, n, s, plane,
             width, hinge, max_in, max_out, room, zone, wing, depth, base}]   # tile space
DoorPlan.leaves(d) / leaf_points(d, leaf, deg, side) / passable(d) / check(state, gen, start)
```

- Kinds: `sliding` the main entrance (four glass panels into the wall), `gate` the doorway into each
  wing (heavy double doors, small wired windows, hazard band, a lock lamp), `double` the cafeteria,
  radiology, morgue and (polish-or-doors) the OR, `hinged` every other room door. `auto` (the same
  heavy look as `gate`, in light steel) is unused since polish-or-doors moved the OR to `double`; kept
  in `door.gd`/`door_models.gd` for a future automatic door rather than deleted.
- Each doorway is a tunnel one tile deep. A door hangs just inside one face (`n` points out of it):
  room doors at the hallway face, gates and the OR at the side you reach first from the entrance
  building, the sliding doors at the outside face. Swinging toward -n folds a leaf into the tunnel
  (always 90 degrees, nothing stands in a doorway); toward +n needs room: `max_out` is the widest
  angle whose whole sweep (10 degree steps) meets no wall, furniture below 2.2 m, container or other
  door, and a single leaf's hinge is on the end that allows more. `validate()` runs
  `DoorPlan.check`: a door in every doorway, every sweep clear, every room reachable through doors
  that open at least 75 degrees (hinged) or 40 (pairs).
- `base` doors (the entrance building's) never change within a run; the rest belong to the wings.

### Builder parts

```gdscript
HospitalBuilder.PART_BASE / PART_WINGS
HospitalBuilder.part_of(gen, x, y)           # entrance and outdoor (and unused solid) tiles are the base
HospitalBuilder.warm_parts()                 # main thread, before any prepare() on a thread
HospitalBuilder.prepare(gen, part) -> Dictionary      # data only (mesh arrays, MultiMesh buffers,
                                             # collision faces per chunk, lists); thread-safe after warm_parts
HospitalBuilder.commit_steps(prep, parent) -> Array[Callable]   # small node-creating steps
HospitalBuilder.finish_info(gen, info, base_prep, wings_prep)
HospitalBuilder.bake_nav(gen) -> NavigationMesh       # data only; door tiles are walkable
info.wings_root   # the Hospital's "Wings" node (everything PART_WINGS)
info.base_part    # the base part's committed lists (anchors, lights, doors), kept for rebuilds
info.door_nodes   # every door node of the level; info.doors the plan data; info.wing_gen, wing_seed
info.occluders_built   # true: the builder made per-part wall occluders, game._add_occluders skips
```

A wall face belongs to the part of the open tile it looks into. `build(gen, info)` is unchanged for
callers: it prepares and commits both parts at once.

### Doors (`game.doors`, child "Doors" of Game, every machine)

```gdscript
doors.doors: {id: door node}; doors.near(pos) -> Array; doors.door_at_tile(t); doors.nearest(pos)
doors.register(nodes) / unregister_wings() / clear()

doors.apply_net(g) / on_event(kind, data)    # clients; events "dr_*"
doors.stats                                  # opens by who, slams, jams (tests)
# door.gd
door.kind, door_id, data, amount (hinged -1..1 signed side; automatic 0..1), target, speed, locked,
door.swing (automatic pairs: -1 into the tunnel, +1 out), max_in, max_out, normal, along, centre,
door.leaf_bodies (AnimatableBody3D on C.L_WORLD, each with an Area3D "Aim" on C.L_INTERACT),
door.occluder (QuadOccluder3D, visible while shut), door.lamp_state ("locked" | "unlocking" | "open")
door.is_closed() / is_hinged() / is_automatic() / limit(side) / leaf_xform(i, a) / snap_to(a) / step(dt, check)
```

- **Automatic doors** (the wing gates and the main entrance; the OR's doors are `double`/manual since
  polish-or-doors, see below) open while anyone is within 3.4 m in front of either face (4.6 m for a
  crew): players (downed too), paramedic crews, monsters. Closed pairs pick their swing then: into
  the tunnel, or out of the face when the nearest one is coming through the tunnel and there is room.
  They close 1.2 s after nobody is near. A locked gate opens for nobody.
- **Gates** are locked (host: `phase != SHIFT or not wing_loader.wings_ready`),
  shut, lamp red, prompt "!Locked until the shift starts", E plays `doors_locked`. Unlocking plays
  `doors_unlock` and holds each gate open 2.6 s. While a clock-in waits for the wings the lamps
  blink amber. **Jams**: a gate of one of the two deepest wings (three or more wings), once per
  opening and not on the unlock, 30% chance: it stops at about 55% (a passable gap) and shudders
  for 1.6-3.4 s with `doors_jam` (noise 0.35), then opens; 45-90 s cooldown.
- **Hinged and double doors**: E toggles (the OR's doors, `double` since polish-or-doors, open the
  same way as the cafeteria/radiology/morgue's). Opening swings away from the player (into the
  tunnel if the far side has under 80 degrees of room), at 1.9/s; closing at 1.6/s, or a slam
  (5.5/s, noise 0.95) if the door was still moving or the player sprints. Doors stay where they are
  left. Bots, and players carrying someone or dragging a monster (E is taken), push them open by
  walking into them. The paramedic crew wheeling the gurney (E is taken there too) pushes the OR's
  own doors open the same way, but *only* the OR's doors: the crew never walks anywhere else in the
  hospital, so `doors.gd` scopes its push check to `kind == "double" and base` rather than every
  hinged/double door, to keep a stray delivery from nudging some unrelated room door. A door
  sweeping into a player stops and waits (a dropped item stops a closing door too); the one who
  opened it is not in its way.
- **Monsters**: agents walking into a hinged or double door (including the OR's, now that they are
  `double`) open it by kind while wandering or rushing: the
  Hive pushes slowly (0.42/s, a creak, noise 0.5), the Sonographer rushing bursts it (7/s, a slam,
  0.95) and otherwise creaks it open, the Night Nurse opens it silently (2.2/s) only while she is not
  observed and nobody is watching the doorway (`Perception.observed_any` at the door, 5 Hz). Doors
  never close by themselves, so a door left shut can be open later.
- **Sight and light**: leaves are on `C.L_WORLD`, so every sight ray (perception, the Hive's eyes,
  the flashlight check) and the flashlight's shadow stop at a closed door. A leaf folded open past
  90% stops colliding (its aim area stays). The Sonographer's hearing multiplies a noise's reach by
  `sound_factor` (a hook in `sonographer_brain.gd`).
- **Replication**: global fields `d.<id>` (amount in fiftieths; automatic pairs signed by swing) in
  group `"dr"`, `dl` (gates locked), `du` (unlocking), `wg` (the wings' generation). Clients animate
  toward the replicated amount and never halt on their own; their gates also stay locked while their
  own wings are still building. Sounds go through `game._sound` events.
- Sounds (`tools/gen_audio_doors.mjs`): `doors_hiss`, `doors_heavy`, `doors_creak_01/02`,
  `doors_latch`, `doors_slam`, `doors_locked`, `doors_unlock`, `doors_jam`.

### The wings per shift (`game.wing_loader`, child "WingLoader" of Game, every machine)

```gdscript
wing_loader.generation      # the wings the level has or is building (replicated as "wg")
wing_loader.wings_ready / busy
wing_loader.regenerate(generation)   # host: game._to_next_shift (and the dev panel); clients: on "wg"
wing_loader.finish_now()             # tools, begin_shift
wing_loader.generation_for_build(shift) / next_generation / on_level_built(info) / cancel()
wing_loader.has_wings() / gate_front(wing_id, slot) / evict_players()
wing_loader.stats            # frames, max_frame_ms, slowest_step(_ms), thread_ms, wall_ms, finish_ms,
                             # steps {label: [count, total ms, worst ms]}
signal wings_torn_down                              # POCKETS HOOK: tear down extra wing content here
signal wings_built(info, wing_seed, generation)     # POCKETS HOOK: build extra wing content here
wing_loader.extra_builders   # objects with build_wings(info, wing_seed, generation) / teardown_wings()
game.clock_in_pending        # host: clock-in waits for the wings
```

- `_to_next_shift` calls `regenerate(max(shift, generation + 1))`. Host: players (and bots) in a wing
  are put in the entrance hall in front of that wing's gate (a reliable `dr_evict` to a client);
  world items in the wings are removed (the guide goes back to its lectern); monsters in the wings
  go quietly (only a dev rebuild during a shift has any). Every machine: the old wings leave
  `level_info` (containers, lights, anchors, tool and monster spawns drop to the base part's),
  `wings_torn_down` fires, the old nodes are freed a few per frame; MapGen, `prepare` and the
  navigation bake run on a WorkerThreadPool task; `commit_steps` and the fixtures' flicker
  controllers run within 5 ms per frame; then `level_info` gets the new wings, the navigation mesh
  is swapped, doors register, `wings_ready` turns true and `wings_built` fires. During a shift (dev)
  loot and monsters respawn for the new wings.
- `clock_in()` while the wings build sets `clock_in_pending` ("The wing doors are unlocking...") and
  clocks in the moment they are ready; `begin_shift()` finishes them at once.
- Joining: the snapshot's `wg` is applied before a joining client builds the level
  (`next_generation`), so it builds the host's current wings directly.
- Extra per-shift wing content (the `pockets` worker's pocket spaces) builds in `wings_built` and
  tears down in `wings_torn_down` (or via `extra_builders`). `wings_built` also fires after a full
  level build. Hallway stubs that are not `+` doorway tiles never get a door.
- Containers are the costly step (primitive meshes merged by `ContainerBase.bake`, 10-30 ms each
  in a window). `bake` now caches the merged mesh by its parts (primitive kind and size, transform,
  material), so a container built the same way again shares it: a rebuild's container steps went
  from 57 steps / 1330 ms (worst 35-43 ms) to 163 ms (worst 8 ms). Children that are not primitive
  meshes skip the cache. Keep container materials shared (`ContainerMats`), or every build misses.

### Dev room

- The pen has two partitions with doors (`dr_dev_hinged`, `dr_dev_double`); monsters spawn in its
  middle bay and reach the side bays through them.
- Panel section "Doors": "Open all doors", "Close all doors" (hinged doors; requests `doors_all
  {open}`), "Regenerate wings now" (`regen_wings`).

### Tests

`tools/doortest.tscn` (headless: 75 checks; `-- --shots` windowed into `tools/door_shots/`;
`-- --frames` windowed frame times while the wings rebuild), `tools/mapcheck.gd` (door checks through
`validate`, door nodes in builds, later shifts keep the entrance), `tools/looptest.tscn` (new wings at
shift 2), nettest scenario `doors`, devtest door checks, `tools/perfprobe.tscn -- --doors`.

## Design decisions (locked)

- Each patient is Bob or the seal with one ailment (gunshot or amputation). Sweep 2: one patient
  per shift plus an optional extra one on the second table (see "Shift loop and patients").
- Items are always physical 3D models: in containers that visibly open, or loose. Aim + E.
- Consumables come in batches; a batch is one hand slot; stacks merge; each use consumes one;
  fragile stacks lose about a third when dropped, never all of it. Getting hit or shoved drops
  both hands.
- Containers stay open once opened; E toggles. Red herring items spawn.
- A softlock guard respawns supply far away if breakage makes the shift unwinnable.
- Each step is its own in-world minigame; botches cost vitals only. Underdosing makes the
  patient stir in later steps; a weak tourniquet makes the saw step bloody.
- The medical guide is a physical binder on a lectern, carryable, with item pages, procedure
  checklists and locked placeholder tabs.
- Monsters: The Sonographer (blind, hunts by sound, clicking, its neck grows as it gets suspicious, shove stuns it) and
  The Night Nurse (moves only while no one is looking at it with light on it, shove does
  nothing, 2 hearts).
- Not in this sweep: networked physics beyond dropped items, the cart, two-person steps,
  voice chat, classes, progression, cosmetics.

## Review setups (2026-09-18)

`scripts/review_setups.gd` (`ReviewSetups`): `--setup=<name>` after `--` (tools/review.ps1 passes it on;
`--seed=N` overrides the setup's seed) makes a review window skip the title menu: `main._launch` calls
`main._boot_setup`, which starts a solo host session on the setup's seed, `game.begin_shift()`s, waits
45 frames, then runs `ReviewSetups.stage(name, game)`. A setup is one entry in `SETUPS`
(`{"seed": 4242, "stage": "_name"}`) and one static function that stages things with the helpers
`place`, `clear_hands`, `give` (a stack, with extra stack keys like `bt`, `used`, `x`), `give_abilities`
and `floor_item`. An unknown name is logged with the known ones and the menu opens as usual. Setups so
far: `icons`.
