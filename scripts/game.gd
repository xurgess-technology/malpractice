## The world and the whole shift simulation.
##
## The host owns the truth: monsters, items, containers, the shelf, the case on the table,
## damage and phase changes. Every player owns their own surgeon's movement and aim and
## reports it. Clients mirror the host through a 20 Hz snapshot. Solo play is hosting with
## nobody connected.
##
## Level geometry is never networked: each peer builds it locally from the shared seed, so
## anything derived from the level (containers, their ids) matches on every machine.

#
# Snapshots (host -> each client, unreliable, SNAPSHOT_HZ):
#   The host builds one "state" per tick: sections of entity reports keyed by id
#     g   the global fields (time, phase, cases, shelf, surgery, loop...) as a few entities
#         grouped by which fields come and go together (_global_groups)
#     pl  players, mo monsters, it world items: id -> report dictionary (without "id")
#     ct  open containers: interact_id -> {} (absent means closed)
#   Replication is per field with acknowledgements, so no message ever depends on another one
#   arriving and no message is ever large:
#   - For each client the host remembers, per entity field, the value that client has confirmed
#     (acked) and the value still in flight. A field is sent when the current value differs from
#     what is in flight, or (nothing in flight) from what was confirmed. A lost or timed-out
#     message turns its fields "unknown", so they are sent again with their current values.
#   - Every message carries absolute values and its own sequence number; the client keeps, per
#     field, the newest sequence it applied and ignores older values. Any subset of messages in
#     any order converges to the host's state.
#   - Existence is the field "@": a hash of the entity's field names while it exists, -1 once
#     removed. A client uses an entity only once its own field names hash the same (it holds
#     exactly the host's fields). A change of field names sends the whole entity; a field that
#     left the report is sent as NET_GONE.
#   - Messages are packed up to NET_MSG_BYTES (well under the ENet MTU and Steam's unreliable
#     segment size, so nothing is ever fragmented), in priority order g, pl, mo, ct, it. A burst
#     (clock-in spawns ~70 loot stacks at once, a late joiner needs everything) spreads over as
#     many ticks as it takes: at most NET_TICK_BYTES per tick and NET_WINDOW_BYTES unacknowledged,
#     one small message per tick while the window is full, fewer while the client is silent.
#   Wire format: {s: seq, g/pl/mo/ct/it: {id: {field: value}}}; empty sections are omitted.
#   Clients ack in _player_state([newest seq, bit mask of the 64 before it], ...).
#   Every KEYFRAME_SECONDS a client re-applies its whole replica to its nodes (no bandwidth), so
#   anything local that drifted is put back.
# Discrete one-off things (sounds, messages, hits, phase changes) stay reliable RPCs.
#
# Joining mid-shift: a peer that arrives outside the lobby waits as a spectator (not alive,
# in `waiting_peers`, not counted by all_players_out) and spawns with everyone at the next lobby.
# Leaving: the host drops what the leaver carried where it stood (nothing breaks) and ends
# its operation; the step keeps its progress for whoever operates next.
