## The over-the-shoulder carry camera while the local player carries a downed teammate or a body, or
## drags a monster (docs/HANDS_AND_FEEDBACK.md "Over-the-shoulder carry camera"). Local only: nothing
## new on the wire.
##
## Ordinary play is first person unless the `camera` setting says otherwise (F5 cycles first person
## -> "shoulder" -> "front" -> first person): "shoulder" runs this rig all the time at PLAY_ARM;
## "front" swings the same arm round to the front of the body (ORBIT: the camera travels round the
## player rather than cutting) and turns it to look back at them, centred. Either way the game takes
## the head back while operating, downed, carried, on the table or dead, and carrying or
## dragging swings round behind to their own arms. Facing you, the aim is the head's (the crosshair
## would point at yourself), and the HUD hides the crosshair (front_view()). Framed the way the big third-person games do it (The Last of Us Part II,
## the RE4 remake, God of War): the camera sits close behind and over the RIGHT shoulder, so the
## carrier fills the left third of the screen and the crosshair at the centre is clear; the load
## rides the LEFT shoulder (game.pinned_pose -0.55 x, Player.HUMAN_CARRIED_SHOULDER mirrored,
## corpses.shoulder_pose), where it shows at the left edge without filling the frame.
##
## The rig: a PIVOT at the upper back (just below and behind the eye, in the player's yaw frame),
## then the shoulder offset sideways, then an arm up and back that swings with the look pitch --
## scaled down (ORBIT_K) so looking down lifts the camera a little over the shoulder and looking up
## lowers it a little behind the back, and a little shorter looking up (LOOK_UP_PULL) so it never
## digs into the floor. The camera itself always looks where the head looks, so the crosshair aims
## along the player's aim (aim_segment). A teleport moves it with the player (no easing across the
## world; the wall pull-in snaps to the new place). Sphere casts along the same three legs (head ->
## pivot -> shoulder -> camera) keep it out of walls: in a corridor it pulls in toward the head, and
## the first-person hands take back over if it pulls in far enough to put the camera inside the
## local body. The local body (and the carried body, while carrying) become visible whenever the
## camera is far enough out to show them; the first-person hands and held item show whenever it is
## not. The flashlight stays at the head, pointed where the camera looks.
## After a body goes into the furnace the camera lingers over the shoulder for LINGER_SECONDS so the
## carrier sees it roll off into the fire (linger(), corpses.gd).
## Setting `carry_camera`: "shoulder" (default) or "first_person", for the carry/drag states when
## the `camera` setting is first person.
