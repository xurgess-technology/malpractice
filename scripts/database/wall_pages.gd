## What the break room's wall terminal shows (terminal redesign, chunk 2), as data: the four
## sections, the entries in each, and every entry's page. wall_terminal_ui.gd draws it.
##
##   SECTIONS                          [{id, title}] in home-grid order
##   entries(section, view) -> Array   [{key, title, known}]; unknown entries show "???" and can't open
##   page(section, key, view) -> Dict  {title, subtitle, paragraphs: [String], hint, models: [{monster} |
##                                      {item, count, link, label}], ability: {name, levels: [String]}
##                                      (monsters); a procedure's steps are a paragraph and its tools
##                                      links (link: a surgery item's key, label over it when pointed at)
##
## `view` is whose database the screen shows (wall_session.gd view()): {db: {kind: bits (1 sighted,
## 2 scanned, 4 harvested)}, peer, brains}; nobody signed in is an empty db and peer 0.
## Known: surgery items and procedures always; a monster once scanned; any other item once picked
## up (game.mark_db(kind, "sighted", player) in pickup_item). Ability names show once harvested,
## each level's numbers once the player's brain level reaches it.
