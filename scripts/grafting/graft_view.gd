## GRAFTING chunk C (docs/GRAFTING.md): the first-person tell. A grafted surgeon sees a faint orange
## wash down the LEFT edge of their view -- the side the Hive eyeball is on -- and it comes up while
## Puppet is running (the surgeon is inside a Hive).
##
## It sits ABOVE the look pass's grain, vignette and teal grade (scripts/look.gd, canvas layer 50),
## which the HUD deliberately sits under: graded, a faint orange on a teal picture disappears
## completely. Local and cosmetic; what drives it (game.grafts.local_lock) is replicated, so it can
## never disagree with the glow everyone else sees on the eye.
