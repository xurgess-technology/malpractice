## "Is anybody looking at this, and can they actually see it?"
##
## A point counts as observed when some living player
##   1. has it inside their camera's view frustum,
##   2. with a clear line of sight from the camera (ray on C.L_WORLD), and
##   3. the point is lit: by any living player's flashlight cone or near-glow
##      (Player.lights_point), or by a ceiling fixture that is on right now, in range,
##      with line of sight to the point.
##
## One thing observes without being anybody: a burning votive candle from the Chapel counts every
## point within Trinkets.CANDLE_RADIUS of it as observed, with nobody looking and nobody alive to
## look. That test runs first, before any of the three above.
##
## Cost, cheapest test first, early out on the first success:
##   frustum: pure maths per player. Rays only for players whose view contains the point.
##   flashlight: one ray per player whose cone/glow reaches the point.
##   fixtures: a squared-distance cull over level_info.lights, then an energy check,
##   then one ray per candidate (in practice 0-2 fixtures are within 5 m of a point).
## Callers (the Night Nurse) sample this a few times per second, not every frame.
