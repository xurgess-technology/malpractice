## The one place that knows the player body rig (docs/CONTRACTS.md "Player: hands", the rig seam).
##
## Today the body is the Kenney mini character `char/surgeon`: seven bones (root, leg-left,
## leg-right, torso, arm-left, arm-right, head), no hand bones, arms straight out along X in the
## rest pose, the character facing +Z in skeleton space. Its arm is one bone with the mitten at the
## end, so a "hand" is a point near the end of the arm bone.
##
## Swapping in another rig (the shared Blender human) is a data change: add an entry to RIGS with
## that rig's bone names, hand sockets and rest directions, and have `detect()` pick it. The poses
## below are written as directions in skeleton space (+Z forward, +Y up, the body's right is -X),
## so they carry over to any rig whose arm bones can be pointed.

## skeleton space (no rest-direction assumptions) and body_hands.gd pick the extra clips.
