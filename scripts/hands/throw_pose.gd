## THROW HOOK: the wind-up of a charged throw (hold the drop key, scripts/player.gd), shared by the
## first-person hands (fp_hands.gd) and the third-person body (body_hands.gd). Each driver owns one
## and feeds it Player.throw_wind every frame:
##   > 0   the drop key is held past the tap: the live 0..1 charge (1 = full)
##   < 0   a charged throw just fired (for Player.THROW_FOLLOW_TIME): the follow-through
##   0     nothing (a quick tap never winds up; a cancel lands here and eases back)
## The driver then poses: blend(blend(rest, windup, wind_w()), strike, strike_w()), plus jig() on the
## hands (non-zero only at full charge on a two-handed thing). `two` is latched while the pose plays,
## so throwing the last bulky thing still follows through with both hands.

## Seconds of the snap forward and the return to rest after a charged throw fires.
const FOLLOW_TIME := 0.34
## Share of FOLLOW_TIME spent snapping forward (the rest eases back to rest).
