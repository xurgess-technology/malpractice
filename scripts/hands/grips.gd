## Grip data: where an item model sits in a hand (docs/HANDS_AND_FEEDBACK.md, docs/CONTRACTS.md
## "Player: hands"). `ItemModels.grip(kind)` returns this file's answer.
##
## A hand socket is a frame at the middle of the palm:
##   -Z  the way the fingers point
##   +Y  out of the palm (what a thing lying on an open palm rests against)
##   +X  to the right of the hand (the same for both hands, so the frame stays right-handed)
## A grip names, in the item model's own space (ItemModels.make: origin at the base of the stack):
##   pos    the point that lands in the palm
##   fwd    the model direction that follows the fingers (socket -Z)
##   up     the model direction that points out of the palm (socket +Y)
##   style  "palm" (lies on an open palm, palm up) or "fist" (a handle in a closed hand, thumb up)
##   hands  1, or 2 for bulky things carried in front with both hands
##   bundle the most copies of a stack shown in the hand (a batch is held as a small bundle)
## grip_transform(kind) is the model's transform in socket space: socket * grip_transform places it.
