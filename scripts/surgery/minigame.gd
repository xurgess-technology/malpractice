class_name Minigame
extends Node3D
## Base class for every surgery step. THIS FILE IS A CONTRACT: the surgery system, the
## minigame lab and every individual minigame depend on it. Do not change a signature
## without updating all of them.
##
## A minigame lives on a flat "work plane" laid on the patient at a site marker.
## The node's own transform IS the plane: local X and Z span the plane, local +Y points
## up out of the patient's body. Units are metres, origin is the site marker.
##
## Who runs what:
##   - Every machine instantiates the minigame and calls tick() so it animates.
##   - Only the operating player's machine calls handle_cursor(); it is the authority for
##     that step's progress and botches (co-op with friends: we trust the operator).
##   - The operator's net_state() is relayed through the host to everyone else, who call
##     apply_net_state() so spectators see the tool move.
##   - bot_input() lets tests play the step without a human.

## Vitals damage from a mistake. The host applies it and it costs nothing else.
signal botched(amount: float, reason: String)
## The step is done. `result` is merged into the case flags that later steps read
## (e.g. {"sedation": 0.8} or {"tourniquet": 0.95}).
signal finished(result: Dictionary)

## Everything the step needs to know. Keys the surgery system always provides:
##   patient_id: String, patient: Dictionary (Procedures.PATIENTS entry)
##   ailment_id: String, step: Dictionary (Procedures step), variant: String
##   shift: int, difficulty: float (Procedures.difficulty)
##   flags: Dictionary, results of earlier steps (sedation, tourniquet, ...)
##   seed: int, deterministic per case and step
##   body: Node3D, the PatientBody on the table (may be null in the lab)
##   operator: bool, true on the machine whose player is doing this step
## Optional:
##   helper_lights: Callable -> Array of SpotLight3D, the flashlights of teammates standing by (on,
##     not the operator's). Every machine has them (their aim and on/off are replicated), so a step
##     can use helper_light() to let a teammate's light help on everyone's screen.
