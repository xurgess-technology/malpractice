## The Hive, host side. It only has eyes, and it forgets fast (the hive mind).
##
##   IDLE     stands swaying near where it was left, for a few seconds
##   WANDER   shuffles to a spot a few metres from its home at 0.8 m/s
##   RUSH     it SEES someone: lumbers straight at them at 1.8 m/s (a surgeon walks 3.4)
##            While it sees them it keeps re-aiming at where they are. Once it loses sight
##            it keeps walking to where it last saw them, for at most LOST_WALK seconds.
##   SEARCH   standing at that spot, turning its head this way and that for about 3 s,
##            then it gives up and goes back to wandering
##   STUNNED  shoved (2 s) or struck (a short stagger)
##   RETREAT  after landing a hit it backs off, then stays calm (it will not hit) a while
##
## Sight: a cone of SIGHT_DEG degrees, SIGHT_RANGE metres, a clear line from its eyes to the
## player's head or chest (walls block, darkness does not matter). Checked SIGHT_HZ times a
## second, staggered per Hive, and only for players already inside range and cone, so a
## crowd of Hives costs a handful of rays a second. It ignores noise completely.
