class_name ReviewSetups
extends RefCounted
## Named review setups: `--setup=<name>` after `--` (tools/review.ps1 passes it on) opens a review
## window straight in a shift, solo and hosting, with the player where the setup puts them and the thing
## to test already staged: no home screen, no lobby, no getting ready (RULES.md, Reviews).
##
## main.gd's launch calls requested(); when a name is given (and known) it skips the title menu, starts a
## solo session on the setup's seed (`--seed=N` overrides it), begins the shift and lets the world settle,
## then calls stage(name, game). An unknown name lists the known ones in the log and opens the menu.
##
## To add a setup (one function, one line):
##   1. add an entry to SETUPS:  "hive_lunge": {"seed": 4242, "stage": "_hive_lunge"},
##   2. write   static func _hive_lunge(game: Game) -> void:   using the helpers below.
## `seed` is optional (default DEFAULT_SEED). Stage functions may await (use game.get_tree()).
## Then open it:  tools\review.bat 2 "HIVE: does the lunge read?" --setup=hive_lunge
