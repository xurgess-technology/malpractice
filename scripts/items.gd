class_name Items
extends RefCounted
## Every item in the game, as data. The world, the hands, the OR shelf, the spawner and the
## medical guide all read from here, so adding an item means adding one entry.

## Where an item can turn up. Container types are built by the containers system;
## "loose" means sitting on a counter, tray, gurney or floor edge.

		"loose_surfaces": ["counter", "tray"],
		"real_use": "A general anesthetic puts a patient into a controlled, reversible unconsciousness so they feel nothing during surgery. The dose depends on body weight: too little and they can wake mid-procedure, too much and breathing and heart rate crash.",
		"where": "Almost always in the medicine fridges of pharmacies, supply closets and labs. Now and then a vial or two left out on a counter or a bedside tray.",
		"handling": "Consumable. Found in batches of 2 to 3. Glass: dropping the batch smashes some of it.",

		"real_use": "Gauze is a loose woven cotton dressing. Packed into a wound it applies pressure from the inside and helps blood clot; wrapped around a limb or stump it holds that pressure and keeps the wound covered.",
		"where": "Usually in the drawers of nurse stations and patient room counters. Often a few rolls left loose on counters, trays or gurneys.",
		"handling": "Consumable. Found in rolls of 2 to 4. Survives being dropped.",

		"handling": "Reusable. Heavy. Stays in the OR once delivered.",
