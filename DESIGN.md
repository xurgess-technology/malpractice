# Malpractice (working title) — Design

Last updated 2026-09-17 (Sweep 4A: the ability bar, the database terminal, the fog lot, the pharmacy and crematorium, placebo pills, no gold bars). Items marked **TODO** are wanted but not built yet. Items marked **IDEA** are proposals waiting for a yes.

## Vision

You and your best friends clock into the ER with one goal: save a life. The problem is that the patient is a man who got shot or a seal with a rotting flipper, and the hospital is full of monsters.

**Tone**: chaos and laughing, until it isn't. The signature moment: something creeping toward the OR while two surgeons scramble to finish the procedure, somebody is supposed to be watching the door, and nobody is.

**Genre references**: R.E.P.O. for look and physicality, Lethal Company and Content Warning for the friend-group loop.

**Rating**: bloody, not grim.

## Names (picked 2026-09-17)

- **The game is Malpractice** — the joke is that you are terrible at this. Working title: a Steam game already carries that exact name, so this gets revisited before any public release (**Gross Malpractice** is the fallback, and it was clear on Steam and itch.io).
- **The hospital is St. Doe's General Hospital**, shortened to **Doe General** on faxes and signage. "Code blue" survives in-world as the hospital's own alarm code.
- Dropped: Skeleton Crew, Code Blue, Graveyard Shift, Bedside Manor, Do No Harm, On Call, Stat!

## Players

- Up to 4 players, built so more is possible. Solo works.
- Everyone is a surgeon, first person, with your own hands visible. Over-the-shoulder and facing-you views are options (settings, or F5 to cycle).
- One player hosts over ENet; friends join by address (LAN, port forward or Tailscale). **TODO**: Steam lobbies and invites via GodotSteam.
- **0 HP means downed**, not dead: you lie on the floor, crawl, and bleed out over five minutes. A teammate carries you to the OR's player table and stitches you up with a suture kit. Bleed out and you are dead until the next shift (spectating). Everyone down or dead fails the shift.
- **Friendly fire is a feature**: Q shoves whatever is in front of you. A shoved teammate drops everything, and the vials smash.
- **Controls**: crouch (Ctrl, silent footsteps, no low-ceiling stand-up), a small grounded jump (Space), hold R to scan a monster in view (range and line of sight, a progress ring at the crosshair; built in, not an item or a slot). All rebindable in Settings.
- **Ability bar**: up to 4 abilities, one per slot, in the order you first earn them. Hold Alt to bring the bar up (icons slide in from a small always-visible row); Alt+1-4 fires that slot. Each slot has its own cooldown, level pips, a cost tag (like "LOUD" on Echo) and greys out with a reason when it can't fire. A card introduces a new ability the first time it lands in a slot.
- **TODO**: proximity voice chat (and monsters that hear it), roles and classes, cosmetics, progression.

## The shift

1. Everyone spawns in the clock-in room next to the OR. Aim at the time clock and hold E.
2. One patient with one ailment arrives. Vitals drain the whole shift.
3. Search the hospital for the supplies the procedure needs and bring them to the OR (its storage shelves hold anything you put down).
4. Operate step by step. Each step is its own minigame.
5. Stabilise the patient to punch out. The next shift is harder, with more monsters, and its wings are new: while the team is out in the parking lot the gates stay locked and the wings behind them are rebuilt; the entrance building never changes during a run.
6. Lose if the patient flatlines or everyone is dead.

Run length 10 to 20 minutes. Difficulty rises with the shift number: tighter minigame tolerances, faster vitals drain, more monsters.

## Patients and ailments

| Patient | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Bob** | An ordinary 52-year-old man. |
| **The seal** | A harbor seal. Heavier, so it needs more anesthetic, and its flipper takes more sawing. |

| Ailment | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| **Gunshot wound (GW)** | 1. Sedate (anesthetic). 2. Remove the bullet (forceps). 3. Pack and dress the wound (gauze x1). |
| **Amputation (AM)** | 1. Sedate (anesthetic). 2. Apply the tourniquet. 3. Saw through the infected arm or flipper (bone saw). 4. Dress the stump (gauze x2). |

Ailments refer to named sites (`injection`, `gunshot`, `limb`, `limb_cut`) and each patient body provides a marker for each, so a new patient only needs its markers placed.

## Surgery minigames

Holding E at the table (with the step's supply in your hands, selected) moves your camera over the site and frees the mouse; the tool follows your cursor across a work plane lying on the patient. Teammates see your tool move. Mistakes cost vitals and nothing else.

- **Anesthetic**: draw the plunger to the dose band for this patient's weight, then hold the needle steady on the vein. Underdosing makes the patient stir and jolt your hands in later steps; overdosing costs vitals.
- **Forceps**: steer down a winding wound channel to the bullet, grip it, and draw it back out without touching the sides. Dark deep in the wound: a teammate's flashlight helps.
- **Tourniquet**: slide it above the infection line and cinch it, then crank the windlass into the right pressure and lock it. A weak tourniquet makes the saw step bloody.
- **Bone saw**: long, steady strokes on tempo along the cut line, fast through skin, slow through bone.
- **Gauze**: pack the gunshot wound and wrap it, or wrap the stump, keeping the tension even.

**TODO**: two-person steps (one holds, one cuts).

## Items

All items are physical 3D objects: on shelves, in containers, in hands, on the OR shelf.

| Item | Used in | Consumable | Found |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anesthetic | GW, AM | yes, batches of 2 to 3, fragile | medicine fridges (pharmacy, storage); sometimes loose |
| Gauze | GW, AM | yes, rolls of 2 to 4 | nurse-station drawers; often loose on counters, trays, gurneys |
| Forceps | GW | no | steel drawer units (storage, maintenance); sometimes on a tray |
| Tourniquet | AM | no | red trauma bags (corridors, nurse stations); sometimes dropped |
| Bone saw | AM | no | pegboards (maintenance, storage); sometimes leaning on a gurney |

- **Loot** is what you find to sell at the furnace: five plain kinds (pill bottle, X-ray film, heart monitor, gold watch, portable ultrasound) and six trinkets (desk phone, laptop, defibrillator, reflex hammer, EpiPen, pulse oximeter), which sell too but are rarer and each also do one thing (see **Trinkets** below). Loot is scarce: 15 to 20 stacks a shift, about $1,000 in all, so most rooms hold nothing and a harvested brain is a real share of a shift's pay. Anything that isn't bulky can turn up in a container too.
- **Aim and press E** for everything: take items, open and close containers, put things on the OR's storage shelves, clock in, revive, operate.
- **Two hands.** A batch fills one hand; picking up more of the same consumable merges into it. 1, 2 or the mouse wheel switch hands; G sets the selected stack down gently.
- **Getting hit or shoved** drops both hands; fragile stacks lose about a third, never all of it.
- Containers stay open once opened (so the team can see what has been searched); E closes them again.
- Items the current ailment does not need also spawn, so the pool feels real.
- **Softlock guard**: if breakage leaves the shift unwinnable, fresh supply quietly appears somewhere far away.
- **Charged throw**: hold the drop key to charge a throw, release to fire it (a quick tap still just drops). Used to sell loot into the crematorium furnace and to throw placebo pills.
- **Placebo pills**: a $15 bottle of 10, sold only at the pharmacy, does nothing mechanically and burns for $0. Swallow one from the bottle, or throw one at a teammate (a warm, cozy screen effect and a line only they see) or at a patient/monster (the line floats above them in quotes for everyone nearby; an OR patient's monitor shows a hopeful green blip, vitals unchanged). A miss just leaves it on the floor as a pickup.
- **Rocket boots**: $100 a pair, sold only at the pharmacy. Worn, not carried: taking a pair puts them on (hands stay free), one pair each, kept through death until a new run. Hold crouch through a sprint-dive and they light: you fly straight ahead, level and fast, on a second bar under stamina (fuel, about 1.5 s of burn, refilling on the ground). Let go and you drop into the normal dive landing. Fly head first into a wall and you faceplant: the burn stops, you bounce back and drop, and it costs a heart.
- **TODO**: the shopping cart, more item types (sedative dart, batteries, keys).

### Trinkets

Six pieces of loot that sell like any other, but each does one thing, so picking one up is always a
question: use it or sell it? They are rarer than plain loot (three to five in a shift). Left mouse
uses the one in your hand. **A one-use trinket, once spent, is greyed with a crack across its icon
and sells for a few dollars of scrap** — never nothing.

| Trinket | What it does | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Desk phone** | Set it down and it rings loudly for about 10 s: a decoy that pulls anything with ears (and turns the deaf Hives nearby toward it). Pick it up and do it again. **Every time you pull it out there is about a 12% chance it goes off in your hands.** | Reusable |
| **Laptop** | Open it for about six seconds of a plan of the 25 m around you, with a blip for every surgery item in range. Then the battery dies. | Scrap |
| **Defibrillator** | Aim at a downed teammate and they come straight back up **where they lie** — no carrying them to a table. Bulky (two hand slots), and very loud: a real noise event. | Scrap |
| **Pulse oximeter** | In the same window as the sedative jab (a monster stunned by a shove), clip it on **instead of** sedating. The monster gets up and carries on, and from then on **the whole team hears its heartbeat**, positional and through walls: slow while it wanders, faster when it is suspicious, racing when it hunts. You get the pulse oximeter back, on the floor, when that monster is caught or killed. The Night Nurse can't be tagged. | Reusable |
| **Reflex hammer** | Bonk anyone in reach and **they instantly spin 180°**. A teammate's camera snaps round. A Hive loses sight of you and starts searching the wrong way. The Night Nurse has no reflexes and ignores it. Short cooldown. | Reusable |
| **EpiPen** | Jab yourself or a teammate: double sprint speed, and no getting out of breath, for 10 s — then a 3 s collapse where you stand. | Scrap |

## The database terminal

A computer terminal in the break room, opened with E; full-screen, and you can't move while using it. It replaced the old guide binder entirely — no carryable version.

- Three sections: Monsters, Abilities, Items & Procedures.
- Monster entries unlock in tiers as you learn more about that species: **sighted** (name, silhouette), **scanned** (behaviour, senses, threat, sedative doses, an X-ray of where its brain sits), **harvested** (the brain's look, spoil time, the ability it grants, a level table). The Night Nurse has no brain, so her entry never reaches tier 3.
- Items and procedures are unlocked from the start, same as the old guide.
- The database belongs to the host, saved to disk, and survives a wipe; guests share the host's copy for the session but don't keep their own.

## The hospital

- One floor: the entrance building (break room with the time clock, phone and database terminal, the OR, lobby with the pharmacy window and crematorium, and personnel) and three or four procedurally generated wings behind it, with an outdoor lot outside the main doors: empty asphalt and fog, nothing else. Thick fog rings the lot; walk into it and visibility and sound fall away within a few metres, and past a certain depth you're quietly turned back toward the lot before you ever touch anything. Player spawns and respawns are inside, in the lobby.
- **The ambulance** drives itself out of the fog for every patient delivery, parks at the bay, unloads along the gurney walk, and drives back into the fog once it's done; it stops and honks for anyone standing in its lane rather than hitting them.
- **The pharmacy** is a window behind a steel grate in the lobby: order with E, and a pneumatic tube thunks a capsule into a wall slot a moment later. Sells placebo pills and rocket boots.
- **The OR**: three tables along one wall, each with its monitor and surgical lamp, an anesthesia cart between each pair, the crash cart by the west wall and the scrub sinks by the doors. Across from the tables, on your left coming in, a **lab wall** of benches with shelves of bottles over them: a fume hood, a blood bank fridge with gas cylinders, specimen jars and a dissection tray, a microscope, racks of vials and beakers, a centrifuge, a blood analyser and a lab sink with an eyewash. Two of the benches are **vat benches**: three empty specimen vats stand there at the start of a run, with shelves of jars over them, mostly heads. The old locker bay is the lab's storage now, glass supply cabinets and shelving, and the scalpel and eye spoon start there. Every OR table has a small **vat stand** beside it, where the vat sits while someone is being grafted.
  - **TODO**: the lab stations do things, the centrifuge first (spinning vials).
- **The crematorium** is a room off the spine with a lit furnace, and the fire is its only light. Charred brick walls, floor and ceiling. Junk and the dead are heaped up both long walls, tallest at the wall: garbage and biohazard bags, body bags, sheeted corpses with a foot and a toe tag out, skulls and bones, bins, drip stands, broken chairs, bloody rags. Only a lane is left from the doors to the furnace, with a drag trail of blood down it; the end by the furnace stays low, under the hatch. Selling loot means throwing it through the grate into the fire (a miss bounces off the frame); a burst of flame and the amount floating up confirms a sale. Bodies (downed, dead, carried) bounce off the grate like a miss and can never go in. No gold bars, no dumpster, no shop van any more.
- **Personnel** is the staff locker room across the spine from the break room, next to the crematorium, and it's lit. Walking in: lockers down the left wall with the four staff lockers (one per player, a blank emblem plate on each door) among them; sinks with mirrors down the right wall, then a big mirror with dressing-room bulbs, practically floor to ceiling; benches between. The mirrors reflect for real, you included. The back half is white tile: three showers on each side wall with a drain under each, and the whole end wall is the palm vein machine, a big screen (off) over a base cabinet with the palm console standing in front of it, tanks of blood either side, a server tower at each end with gauges and panels of lights, blood lines across the top. Set dressing apart from the mirrors.
  - **TODO**: the stations. The lockers open (trophies and badges you've earned inside the door, your emblem on the front); the mirror changes your look (scrubs, cap, mask, clogs); your emblem gets designed somewhere; the vein machine reads your palm and draws your veins on its screen as your skill tree (each main vein a specialty, forks the skills, unlocked ones filled with blood). Unlocks, progression and the skill tree itself are still open questions.
- **Loading gates.** The entrance building and the neutral area stay the same for the whole run. The wings are regenerated for every shift from that shift's seed: from clock-out until clock-in the wing gates are shut and locked (red lamps, a dead-bolt clunk), the wings behind them are torn down and a new layout with fresh supplies, loot and monsters is built, and the gates unlock and swing open when the next shift starts. Anyone still inside a wing at the end of a shift is walked out to the entrance hall; what was left lying in a wing is gone. The build never hitches: the layout and the meshes are worked out on a background thread and put into the world a few pieces a frame; clocking in waits for it (the lamps blink amber).
- **Doors.** Sliding glass doors at the main entrance; heavy automatic double doors with small windows at each wing gate and the OR, which open for anyone close (players, paramedics with the gurney, someone dragging a monster or carrying a player, and monsters); a deep wing's gate now and then stutters and sticks half open for a few seconds. Every other room has hinged doors (double doors on the cafeteria, radiology and the morgue): E opens or closes them, they swing away from you and stay where you leave them. Opening a door makes a small noise, a slam a big one; closed doors block sight and the flashlight and muffle sound. The Hive pushes doors open slowly, the Discharged bursts through when it is chasing, the Night Nurse opens them silently while nobody is looking, so a door you shut can be open later. No locked doors yet.
- Room kinds include wards, storage, offices, pharmacy, maintenance and nurse stations; containers are placed by room kind.
- Dim and half-dead lighting: most ceiling fixtures flicker or are out; your flashlight does the rest.
- **TODO**: power and fuse boxes, hiding spots, multiple floors, locked doors and keys.

## Monsters

Each monster runs on one sense, so players learn them in order: eyes, then ears, then being watched.

| Monster | Sense | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The Hive** | Eyes | A shambling patient, common near the start of every wing. Sees you and lumbers slowly after you; break line of sight and it loses interest within a few seconds. Deaf. Weak: the easy fight that teaches the saw and the capture loop. Hives share a hive mind (that is why they forget you so fast). **Look (2026-09-18):** charcoal-grey skin; the skull is broken open and the brain is gone, replaced by a pale shelf fungus that bulges out of the break and roots into the scalp; orange eyes, a soft pinpoint while it wanders and the whole eyeball lit up once it locks on to someone. With no brain, what you harvest from a Hive is an **eyeball** -- taken out on the table, kept in a specimen vat, and grafted into a surgeon (see Grafting). |
| **The Discharged** | Ears | Eyeless and a head taller than a surgeon, with clear ears on the large side of normal that swivel toward sounds. Drags a rattling IV pole. Hunts by sound: the rattle stops, the ears turn, then it rushes the noise. A shove stuns it. Has a brain. |
| **The Night Nurse** | Being watched | Moves only while nobody is looking at it with light on it. A shove does nothing, and neither do the saw or the needle: she is the one you run from. No brain. If she gets a hand on you she takes no hearts: in a snap she has you by the throat with both hands and straightens to her full height, holding you up to her face. Your view is locked on it, straight on, until her head snaps over to one side, cocked, considering you; then she drops you, downed, and is gone, somewhere far off in the dark. About two seconds, and nothing anyone can do. |

Surgery is the worst case: the monitors and the bone saw call the Discharged, and every surgeon's eyes are on the table instead of the door.

## Fighting and capturing monsters (sweep 3)

The core choice in every fight: **kill it to be safe, or catch it to get paid.**

- **Kill:** the bone saw is a weapon (left mouse while holding it). Hits stagger, a few hits kill. Every hit has a chance to snap the saw, which is also the saw the surgery needs. Swinging is loud. A killed monster pays nothing: organs are only worth anything harvested alive.
- **Catch:** shove it (stunned), then jab it with anesthetic (left mouse while holding a vial) inside the stun window. It drops, sedated, for a while. Hold E to drag it, E on a free patient table to strap it down. Strapped monsters cannot hurt anyone.
- **On the table:** sedation wears off, faster with noise (the saw is the loudest). Low sedation makes it stir (the operator's hand shakes); lower still it is awake and thrashing, which botches the work and damages the brain. Anyone can re-dose it with anesthetic from their hands (E at the table), but every dose works for less time than the last.
- **Dissection:** saw open the skull, pull the brain out with the forceps. Botches cost brain condition instead of patient vitals. The finished monster dies on the table.
- **Brains spoil.** A harvested brain loses value quickly: run it to the crematorium (thrown into the furnace, the only sell point now) or to the break-room blender.
- **The blender:** blend a brain and drink it to absorb that monster's knowledge. Per player, and lost on a game over along with the money. The ability it grants lands in the next empty slot of your 4-slot ability bar; its level still comes from these same points.
  - (Hive brains teach nothing any more: **Hive Eyes** comes from the graft, below.)
  - **Hive Eyes** (from a grafted Hive eyeball): fire from its slot to see through a nearby Hive's eyes for a few seconds. Your camera flies there along the navmesh first (about 1-1.5s), then settles into its eyes; your own body stands with glazed eyes teammates can see. A hit snaps you back instantly instead of flying back. More brains: longer range and time, and at level 2+ you can cycle between Hives in range instead of only the nearest. (Later: Puppet, steering it.)
  - Discharged brains, **Echo**: fire from its slot for a loud shriek, visibly coming from you (a pulse ring, a body lean) on every machine; for a few seconds everything nearby shows as outlines through walls. It is loud enough to bring every Discharged in the wing. More brains: bigger radius and longer.
- Later sweeps: Puppet, Rise (get back up as a shambler when downed), visible side effects (pale skin, groans, bigger ears, loud noises hurt), rare strap breaks.

Shift 1 has Hives and one Discharged; the Night Nurse joins from shift 2; more of each on later shifts and with more players.

## Grafting

Body parts come out of monsters and go into surgeons. Every part is named after whoever it came out
of: **Hive's eyeball**, **Zach's eyeball**.

- **Take it out.** Strap a Hive to a table and run **Eyeball Extraction** on it with a scalpel and an
  eye spoon: cut round the eye, scoop it out, snip the optic nerve. One eye per Hive, and the Hive
  dies on the table like any dissection.
- **Keep it.** A part spoils in a minute or two out in the open, clouding over and losing its value.
  A **specimen vat** stops the clock: a glass jar carried in both hands, put down on the lab benches
  or on the stand beside an OR table. A spoiled part cannot be grafted, only sold.
- **Put it in.** A surgeon lies down on any free OR table and straps themselves in, **awake**:
  first person, face up, watching the tools come at their own eye. Somebody else sets the vat on
  that table's stand and runs **Eyeball Grafting**: cut round the socket, scoop the old eye out (it
  drops into the vat), seat the new one, stitch it in. A graft is always a swap, never an empty
  socket, and nothing about it can be botched. You can hold a key to get up until the scoop; after
  that you are committed.
- **What you get.** One normal eye and one orange Hive eye, stitched in and visible to everyone --
  in the mirror, over your shoulder, on other players' screens. It glows low all the time and lights
  right up while you are using **Hive Eyes 1**, which the graft gives you in your next free ability
  slot. Your own view carries a faint orange tint down its left edge, stronger while the ability is
  running. Swap your own eye back in and the ability goes with it.
- A graft lasts the whole run, through death, and is lost on a game over, like the abilities from
  brains. Eyes sell at the crematorium furnace like any other loot.

## Look and sound

- R.E.P.O.-adjacent: chunky low-poly, harsh pools of light, volumetric haze, a sickly teal grade with warm flashlight light. Film grain, vignette and damage effects.
- Generated soundtrack in three phase-locked layers (dread, hunt, critical) plus positional sound effects, all synthesized offline into WAVs.

## Art style: characters and models

Decided 2026-09-18. Every character and monster from here on is built to this style. The first one
is the players' surgeon (`art/stylized/`, key `char/human_surgeon_st`).

**The look: stylized people, not realistic ones.** Near-normal proportions, big simple soft forms,
no pores, wrinkles or anatomy lines. Faces are figurine faces: short and full, a small nose, small
ears pressed to the head, painted brows, a mouth line, big clear eyes. Clothes are stiff and chunky
with thick hems. Grime, blood and wear go in the paint, not the shapes. Aim for "a slightly
exaggerated person", never chibi, never a doll.

**Why this look:**
- **We can make it well, and keep making it.** Every model is generated from Python scripts in
  Blender; nobody on the team sculpts. Realistic humans (the first surgeons, `art/human/`) kept
  landing in the uncanny valley, because small errors in a realistic face read as wrong. Simple
  shapes leave far less to get subtly wrong, so the same scripts turn out consistent characters.
- **It keeps the tone.** Chaos and laughing, until it isn't; bloody, not grim. Pulling a stylized
  friend's eye out is gross and funny; pulling a realistic one's is grim.
- **It serves grafting.** A graft is a normal body with something wrong attached. A clean, simple
  body makes the graft the most detailed thing on screen, so it reads instantly, from across a
  dark room, and the OR close-up of a graft site holds up.
- **It reads in the dark.** Fog, a flashlight cone and film grain eat surface detail. Silhouette,
  posture and colour are what survive, and simple forms have strong silhouettes.
- **The horror comes from elsewhere.** Monsters, darkness, sound and behaviour carry the fear, not
  realistic skin. The Night Nurse shows stylized can be terrifying: she's scary because she's
  exaggerated.

**The rules for every model:**
1. **Separable parts.** Eyes are their own objects in sockets cut to the eyeball. Arms, legs and
   heads are separate pieces on one shared skeleton, with named attach points (sites). A graft is
   a part swap or an add-on at a site, never new art per combination.
2. **One kit.** Players, patients and monsters share the same head, hand and limb code and the same
   skeleton; a new character is mostly new numbers (proportions, colours, wear, posture), which
   keeps them looking like one game and lets every body use the same clips.
3. **Posture tells them apart.** In the dark you tell a teammate from a Hive by silhouette and
   motion first (upright vs. hunched and dragging), colour second.
4. **Game budget.** About 20k triangles per character, two texture atlases (skin, cloth) baked from
   the detailed sculpt, colour masks for the player tint and the surgery sites.
5. **Reviewed from pictures.** Every model goes through front, side and face renders, then shots in
   the game's own lighting (`tools/style_lab`), before it replaces anything.

**What's easy and what's hard in this style** (so new things are designed to it):
- Easy: props, furniture, machines and tools; anything built from simple shapes; grimy materials;
  monsters (off is the point); stiff clothing; wet, glowing organic things like the Growths.
- Take care: faces up close, hands, bare joints that bend (elbows, shoulders under raised arms).
- Avoid: realistic faces and skin, loose draping cloth, fine wispy hair. Hair is fine where the
  character calls for it, built chunky: a solid shell, a bun, thick strands. (Surgeons are bald.)

**Status.**

| Character | Style | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Surgeon (players) | Stylized | Done: bald, short-sleeved scrubs, bare hands; the belly gash for the player table; a Dive clip |
| The Hive | Stylized, in the game | On the surgeon's head and kit with its hunch and dragged leg; charcoal skin, open skull with shelf fungus, orange eyes (a pinpoint wandering, fully lit and the head up on you when locked on). Own clips: idle, a shamble dragging the right leg, a lunge (`art/stylized/st_hive_clips.py`, `scripts/monsters/hive_rig.gd`) |
| Night Nurse | Stylized | Done: soft figurine face under the mask, long chunky hair, detailed painted grime and blood (`art/night_nurse/`); the first model is in `deprecated/` |
| The Sonographer | Stylized | The model is done (chunk A): a blind doctor in old tattered whites, tall and thin, the eye sockets scarred flat, big swivelling ears, an ultrasound probe grown into its right hand with the cable up the arm, gel-slick skin. Its neck is a chain of bones that cranes up about 0.6 m as it gets suspicious, pulling the glowing violet windpipe rings apart: the body is the suspicion meter. Own clips (`art/stylized/st_sono_clips.py`, `scripts/monsters/sonographer_rig.gd`). The hunting is docs/SONOGRAPHER.md chunk B |
| Discharged, Bob, paramedics | Older looks | To move over (the Discharged becomes the Sonographer in chunk B) |

How the models are built and rebuilt: `art/stylized/README.md`.

## Technical shape

- Godot 4.7, GDScript. `docs/CONTRACTS.md` describes how the systems fit together.
- Host-authoritative simulation; each player owns their own movement and aim; 20 Hz snapshots; surgery minigames are run by the operator's machine and reported to the host.
- Everything is testable headlessly: `tools/playtest.tscn` plays full shifts, `tools/nettest.tscn` runs a real host and client, `tools/minigame_lab.tscn` runs any minigame with scripted input.

## Open questions

- Which name?
- Should the database terminal's "where to look" get less reliable on later shifts (entries going missing)?
