# Changelog

Everything that changes in **Malpractice**, newest first. One minor version per day of work, one
patch per thing we did that day. How to add to it: [RULES.md](RULES.md#changelog).

**2026-09-18 (0.6.x)**

- **0.6.16**: The Discharged is gone, the Sonographer is in 🩺
    - Removed: The Discharged, its IV pole and its rattle. Its kind is the Sonographer everywhere now: shifts, brains, the database, dissection and the dev tools. Old databases keep its page.
    - Added: The Sonographer walks the halls. He clicks as he goes and squelches through the gel, and both stop when he stops to listen; his neck grows while he listens and searches.
    - Changed: He hunts the way the Discharged did for now (listen, rush, search). The echo and the rest of his hunting are next.
- **0.6.15**: The Sonographer, finished
    - Changed: He looks almost normal until he gets suspicious, and then his neck grows, and grows, with the glowing windpipe stretching up it.
    - Changed: His right hand is gone: the arm ends at the wrist and an ultrasound wand is fitted there. No cable.
    - Changed: Ears that look like part of his head, a cleaner shoulder and collar line, no head tilt when he charges, and gel that really drips off him.
- **0.6.14**: Slim pickings, full shelves
    - Changed: Loot is scarce: 15 to 20 finds a shift instead of 70, and a shift pays about $1,000 instead of $11,000. Most rooms hold nothing, and a harvested brain is a real chunk of the pay.
    - Changed: Pill bottles and X-ray film are cheap filler now; the ultrasound, heart monitor and gold watch are where the money is.
    - Changed: Anything that fits can turn up in a drawer, bag or pegboard, desk phones and laptops included.
    - Changed: About half again as many surgery supplies: three of every tool the case needs, more anesthetic and gauze, and more of the ones it doesn't.
- **0.6.13**: GRAFTING!!! YOU CAN NOW HAVE A HIVE EYE!!!!!!
    - Added: Every OR table has a vat stand. Strap a surgeon down, put a vat with a Hive's eyeball on the stand, and a teammate swaps it in for one of their eyes: scalpel, eye spoon, eye spoon, stitches. The patient is awake for all of it.
    - Added: A grafted surgeon has one normal eye and one glowing orange Hive eye, on their own body, in the mirrors and on other players' screens, and gets Hive Eyes. Swap back and it's gone.
    - Changed: Hive Eyes only comes from the graft now. The Hive brain no longer teaches it at the blender.
- **0.6.12**: Less to loot
    - Removed: Thirteen kinds of loot (stethoscope, wedding ring, coffee maker and friends).
    - Added: EpiPen and a new pulse oximeter. Trinkets, the loot that also does something, are rarer: three to five a shift.
    - Changed: Radiology and the other rooms that lost loot get some back, and a shift pays about the same.
- **0.6.11**: Icons for everything 🖼️
    - Added: The item bar is icons now: four slots, a name that flashes when you switch, bulky things take two, and a spoiling part drains around its slot.
    - Added: Icons in the ability bar, the database and the OR screen, and picked-up items fly into their slot.
- **0.6.10**: Eyeball Extraction 👁️
    - Added: Take a strapped Hive's eye out with a scalpel and an eye spoon: trace the cut and watch it open on the skin, circle the socket with the spoon, lift the eye on its nerve and slice it.
    - Added: Specimen vats on the lab wall. Put an eye in one to keep it from spoiling, carry it, set it on a lab bench. Eyes spoil outside a vat and sell at the furnace.
    - Added: The scalpel and eye spoon in the OR storage, and jars of heads on the lab wall.
- **0.6.9**: Lie down, doc
    - Added: Hold E at an OR table to strap yourself down, face up and awake. Let go and hold E again to get up.
    - Changed: A strapped-down body lies along the table for everyone, with no torch or other light on it.
- **0.6.8**: A new way of working 🧑‍⚕️🧑‍⚕️🧑‍⚕️
    - Added: One orchestrator agent hands work to subagents in four reusable work slots; see [RULES.md](RULES.md#workflow).
    - Added: Review windows: a game window from a slot, titled with what to go look at. It waits in the taskbar instead of popping up in your face.
    - Changed: Play it first, test it hard later; big test sweeps get batched.
- **0.6.7**: Spring cleaning 🧹
    - Removed: The first Night Nurse, unused models and the old web prototype (moved to `deprecated/`).
    - Removed: Sounds nothing played, and about 320 MB of old screenshots, logs and caches.

    - Added: Its own shamble and lunge, and eyes that flood orange once it's seen you.
    - Changed: There's no brain to take out of it for now; that part is being rethought.
