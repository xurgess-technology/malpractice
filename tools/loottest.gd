## The loot kinds and where they turn up. Builds the hospital for a few seeds (no game session) and
## plans each shift's loot on it.
##
##   godot --headless --path . -s tools/loottest.gd [-- --seeds=1,2,3 --report]
##
## Checks: no cut kind is left in the loot table or its models; every kept kind has a model; every
## room kind that had loot before the cut still gets loot; trinkets are rarer than plain loot;
## every shift holds LootSpawner.LOOT_PER_SHIFT stacks.
## --report also prints each seed's total loot value and the kinds and rooms it landed in.
## Exits 0 when every check passes.
